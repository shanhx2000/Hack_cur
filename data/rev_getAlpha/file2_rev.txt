in physics  sound is a vibration that typically propagates as an audible wave of pressure  through a transmission medium such as a gas  liquid or solid   in human physiology and psychology  sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain     humans can only hear sound waves as distinct pitches when the frequency lies between about    hz and    khz  sound waves above    khz are known as ultrasound and is not perceptible by humans  sound waves below    hz are known as infrasound  different animal species have varying hearing ranges   sound can propagate through a medium such as air  water and solids as longitudinal waves and also as a transverse wave in solids  see longitudinal and transverse waves  below
