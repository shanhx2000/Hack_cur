Keynes       s View  Causes of Depression and Cyclical Unemployment   strong    p ,  p During          capitalist economies of the world found themselves in the grip of depression  Such was the severity of this depression that in the United States  the rate of unemployment rose from     per cent in       to     of the labour force in          p ,  p Besides  there was a drastic decline in Gross National Product  GNP  which fell from     billion dollars in      to     billion dollars in       that is  national income declined by    per cent during these four years period     p ,  div

other European countries also such a grave situation of severe recession and huge unemployment prevailed during this period  Before         and even after it  recessions have occurred in these economies but they have not been as severe as that took place during             p ,  p Classical economists had no valid explanation of such a severe depression and large scale cycli shy cal unemployment of labour  A C  Pigou and other economists of his view attributed this situation to the high wage rates kept by trade unions and Government  Pigou  therefore  suggested all round cut in wages to increase employment and to remove depression and unemployment  However  this solu shy tion of the problem was neither logically sound nor practical to be implemented     p ,  p Keynes challenged this view of the classical economists and put forward a different explanation of depression and cycli shy cal unemployment which was accepted by many as logical and correct  He explained his viewpoint in his now noted work         General Theory of Employment  Interest  and Money         He not only gave a sound and valid explanation of depression and its associated problem of cyclical unemployment but also suggested effective policy measures to cure them     p ,  p According to Keynes  the cause of depression and cyclical unemployment in the industrialised capitalist countries was sharp decline in private investment due to the adverse business expectations about profit making  There was a wave of pessimism prevailing among investors  The decline in private investment due to fall in marginal efficiency of capital  that is  expected rate of return  caused a fall in aggregate demand and resulted in less than full employment equilibrium     p ,  div class

involuntary unemployment that prevails in times of recession depression is called cyclical unemployment and  as we have seen above  according to Keynes  it is due to deficiency of aggregate demand     p ,  p Large fluctuations in investment  according to Keynes  are due to the uncertain basis of profit expectations on which investment decisions are made  To quote him  We have to admit that our basis of knowledge for estimating the yield ten years hence of a Railway  a copper mine  a textile factory  the goodwill of a patent medicine amounts to little and sometimes to nothing     p ,  p In view of this uncertainty of future  Keynes stressed that investment decisions were greatly influenced by how optimistic or pessimistic investors feel  He used the term animal spirits to describe these pessimistic or optimistic expectations of the investors about profit earning from investment projects     p ,  p The term animal spirits implies that there may be no good or intelligent basis for expectations on which inves shy tors base their decisions  Thus the cause of depression or cyclical involuntary unemployment is the deficiency of aggregate demand due to fall in private investment those results from adverse business expectations and loss of confidence of the investor in a market economy     p ,  div class  code block code block    style  margin   px    clear  both   ,  p

illustrated in Fig       It will be seen from Figure      a  that due to adverse profit expectations or pessimism of investors  investment demand curve shifts to the left from II to I       I         With this it will be seen that investment falls from I sub    sub  to I sub    sub  at a given rate of interest     p ,  p  b  a href  http   cdn yourarticlelibrary com wp content uploads

fall in investment demand by I sub    sub  I sub    sub  causes a downward shift in the aggregate expenditure curve from AE to AE sub    sub   See Fig       b   As a result  the equilibrium between aggregated expenditure and aggregate output which was initially at full employment level Y sub F  sub   which corresponds to point E where the aggregate expenditure curve AE sub    sub  intersects    line  falls to the new equilibrium level of income OY sub    sub      p ,  p Therefore  the cause of depression or recession is deficiency of aggregate demand  It should also be noted  that the decline in the level of GNP or national income following the fall in investment and aggregate demand also results in decrease in level of employment in the economy and causes the emergence of large scale cyclical unemployment     p ,  div class  code block code block    style  margin   px    clear  both   ,  p ADVERTISEMENTS   p ,  script async src    pagead  googlesyndication com pagead js

his theory of multiplier Keynes showed that the fall in the level of national income was much greater than that of decline in investment  This can be known by comparing decline in investment demand  l  and fall in national income   Y  in Figure     b      p ,  p  b Explaining Great Depression            Monetarist View    b    p ,  p We have explained above Keynes        view that great depression of         was caused by fall in investment caused by the drastic fall in the profit expectations of business class  The decline in investment  according to him  caused aggregate demand to fall which along with the reverse working of multiplier caused conditions of depression  i e  high rate of unemployment  substantial decrease in GNP and fall in prices  Keynes and his followers emphasise the role of fiscal policy  increase in Government expenditure and cut in taxation  to stimulate investment     p ,  p They downplayed the role of monetary policy and in fact pointed out that monetary policy in the thirties during the depression period proved to be unimportant and ineffective  As a matter of fact  they asserted that monetary policy was tried during the depression period to revive the economy but miserably failed     p ,  div class  code block code block    style  margin   px    clear  both   ,  p ADVERTISEMENTS   p ,  script async src    pagead  googlesyndication com pagead js

businessmen are in the grip of pessimism about future profitability of investment and more money made available through easy and liberal monetary policy would not be effective in reviving the economy  It was in this context that some Keynesian econo shy mists remarked that money does not matter        and also referred to the policy of making more credit available for investment by businesses        you can bring horse to water but cannot make it drink         Thus Keynesian view prevailed during the forties and fifties almost unchallenged     p ,  p Keynes       s view was attacked by Milton Friedman  a Nobel Laureate in economics  in the middle of fifties  Friedman and Schwartz in their important work A Monetary History of the United States        written in      quoted statistical evidence from the United States  and argued that a re examination of the Great Depression of the     s demonstrated that  contrary to general belief  it had been a tragic testament to the great power of monetary policy  not to its impotence            p ,  p They pointed out drastic decline in the quantity of money was made by Federal Reserve System  the Central Banks of the USA  from      to      which was responsible for severe depression in the American economy  They argued that the failure of the Federal Reserve System to prevent bank failures and the drastic decrease in money supply during           increased the intensity of depression  To quote them         The US Federal Reserve System  could have prevented the decline of one third in the quantity of money that occurred from      to       Had it done so  the evidence indicated  the depression would have been far milder and briefer            p ,  p We thus see that Freidman and other monetarists emphasise monetary policy in causing depres shy sion  In fact  they go to the other extreme view        money alone matters         However  in our view in recent recession during           the Fed Reserve System made successive cuts in rate of interest more than   times to revive the American economy without any success     p ,  p For stimulating investment and growth  it cut the rate of interest even below   per cent  the lowest in the last    years but failed in its objective to overcome recession  Even in India Reserve Bank also lowered the bank rate  several times during                   and reduced it to   per cent         the lowest in forty years to bring about industrial recovery but it had also not much effect seems     p ,  p In the case of the USA  the signs of recovery in the first quarter of         seem to have been the result of drastic reduction in taxation to the extent of     billion dollars and huge increase in defence expenditure for war in Iraq  Both of these are fiscal policies suggested by Keynesians that seems to have worked to start a recovery in the American economy     p ,  p To conclude  in the view of present author the truth lies in between the two extreme views of Keynes and Friedman  Therefore  a majority of modern economists give importance to both fiscal and monetary policies for influencing investment and growth in GNR Both can be complements to each other  Furthermore  profit expectations of entrepreneurs and cost and availability of credit play a significant role in determining national income  employment and price level in the economy   p ,  div id
