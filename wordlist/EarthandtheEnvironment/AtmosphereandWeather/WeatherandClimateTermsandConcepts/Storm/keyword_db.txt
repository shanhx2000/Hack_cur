, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Copyright The Columbia University Press, storm, disturbance of the ordinary conditions of the atmosphere attended by wind, rain, snow, sleet, hail, or thunder and lightning. Types of storms include the extratropical cyclone, the common, large-scale storm of temperate latitudes; the tropical cyclone, or hurricane, which is somewhat smaller in area than the former and accompanied by high winds and heavy rains; the tornado, or
"twister,"
a small but intense storm with very high winds, usually of limited duration; and the thunderstorm, local in nature and accompanied by brief but heavy rain showers and often by hail. The term storm is also applied to blizzards, sandstorms, and dust storms, in which high wind is the dominant meteorological element.
A storm surge, sometimes called a tidal wave, is a flood of ocean or lake water that occurs in areas subject to tropical storms and bordering on shallow waters, but any strong low-pressure system in a coastal area, such as a northeaster along the Atlantic coast of North America, may produce a storm surge. Storm surges are due mostly to wind, which pushes the water ahead of a storm. In Galveston, Tex., in 1900 a hurricane with a wind velocity of more than 100 mi (160 km) per hr caused an ocean storm surge 15 ft (5 m) above normal high tide levels that flooded coastal areas, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and extensive property damage. The highest storm surge on record in the United States is that caused by Hurricane Katrina (2005), which had sustained winds at landfall in SE Louisiana of more than 140 mi (225 km) per hr and a storm surge that by one estimate reached 29 ft (8.8 m) on the SW Mississippi coast and caused coastal devastation from SE Louisiana to Alabama.,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, A storm is any disturbance in the atmosphere that has noticeable effects on Earth’s surface. The term suggests disagreeable weather conditions that may bring discomfort, inconvenience, economic disaster and loss of human lives. In spite of that fact, storms have a generally positive effect on the environment and on human societies because they are the source of most of the rain and snow on which the planet depends., Among the many kinds of storms that exist are thunderstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and ice and hail storms. As different as these types of, storms may be, they possess a few common characteristics. They all result from significant atmospheric instabilities, and they all involve dramatic convection currents in which air masses travel upwards at high rates of speed., The formation of a thunderstorm is typical of the way many storms develop. Imagine that a large mass of air encounters conditions that force it to move upwards. An approaching front or some kind of geographical barrier might produce such an effect. The air mass will continue to rise as long as it is warmer than the atmosphere around it. The upward movement of such an air mass constitutes a convection current., At some point, moisture within the air mass may begin to condense, releasing heat as it does so. When this happens the convection current may begin to move even more rapidly. The upward movement of air in a thunder cloud has been measured at more than 50 mph (80 km/h). As the upward movement of air continues, more moisture condenses out of the air mass and a large cloud begins to form. Depending on atmospheric conditions, a thundercloud of this type may rise to a height of anywhere from 6-9 mi (10-15 km). Eventually, ice crystals within the thundercloud will begin to condense as rain, snow, or some other form of precipitation and a thunderstorm will occur., Some of the most severe types of storms (tornadoes and hurricanes, for example) occur when the upward convention current receives a rotational push. This push converts a purely vertical air movement into a spiraling motion characteristic of these great tropical and mid-latitude storms., See also Air masses and fronts; Cyclone and anticyclone; Tornado.,
