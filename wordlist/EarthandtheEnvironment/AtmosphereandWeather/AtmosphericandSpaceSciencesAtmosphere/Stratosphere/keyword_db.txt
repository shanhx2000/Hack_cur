[Copyright The Columbia University Press, stratosphere (străt´əsfēr), second lowest layer of the earth's atmosphere. The level from which it extends outward varies with latitude; it begins c.51/2 mi (9 km) above the poles, c.6 or 7 mi (c.10 or 11 km) in the middle latitudes, and c.10 mi (16 km) at the equator, and extends outward c.20 mi (32 km). It is a zone of dry, thin air, cold and clear, with a horizontal temperature gradient, that, in its lower level, is the reverse of that near the earth's surface. In polar regions the temperature is -40°F to -50°F (-40°C to -46°C), but near the equator it ranges from -80°F to below -100°F (-62°C to below -74°C); in the middle latitudes it remains steady at about -67°F (-55°C).
The stratified variations in temperature were deduced from the behavior of sound waves transmitted through the atmosphere, which travel faster in warm air than in cold air. Weather balloons carrying electronic equipment are launched to ascertain conditions in the stratosphere; information on this atmospheric layer is also acquired from earth-orbiting satellites.Within the stratosphere at altitudes of 12 to 30 mi (19–48 km) is the ozone layer. Its capacity to intercept most of the sun's ultraviolet rays is fundamental to the maintenance of life on the earth. Without this filtering effect, the sun's full radiation would destroy animal tissue, but sufficient ultraviolet radiation reaches the earth to support the activation of vitamin D in humans. Elevated temperatures found in the ozone layer result from its absorption of radiant energy.Measurements of Antarctica's ozone layer have registered a consistent seasonal
"hole,"
or thinning, in the layer above the South Pole since 1985, and since then similar thinnings have been found over other areas of the world. There is evidence that the ozone is being broken down by chlorine atoms that are released when sunlight breaks up substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Montreal Protocol and its amendments now ban these substances and have set time limits on the production of others that may also affect the ozone layer.,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, A layer of the atmosphere that lies between about 7 and 31 mi (11 and 50 km) above the earth's surface, bounded at the bottom by the tropopause and at the top by the stratopause. Scientists became aware of the presence of the stratosphere with observations of high level dust after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. However, the real discovery of the stratosphere had to await Teisserenc de Bort's work of 1900., The stratosphere is characterized by temperatures that rise with height. As a result, the air is very stable, not mixing much vertically, and allowing distinct layers of air, or strata, to form. There are also persistent regular strong winds, of which the best known are the intense western winds during the winter called the polar night jet stream., The air in the stratosphere has much the same composition as the lower atmosphere except for a higher proportion of ozone . Absorption of incoming solar energy by this ozone makes the upper parts of the stratosphere warm and sets up the characteristic temperature gradient. The relatively high ozone concentrations are maintained by photochemical reactions. It has become clear in more recent years that other chemical reactions involving nitrogen and chlorine are also important in maintaining the ozone balance of the upper atmosphere. This balance can be easily disturbed through the input of additional nitrogen oxides and halogen compounds (from CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons ). Transfer of gases across the tropopause into the stratosphere is rather slow, but some gases, such as CFCs and nitrous oxide , are sufficiently long-lived in the troposphere to leak across into the stratosphere and cause ozone layer depletion . Large volcanic eruptions can have sufficient force to drive gases and particles into the stratosphere where they can also disturb the ozone balance. High-flying aircraft represent another source of pollution in the stratosphere, but the lack of development of a supersonic passenger fleet has meant that this contribution has remained fairly small., The stratosphere is extremely cold (about −112°F [−80°C]) in places, so there is relatively little water. Nevertheless, nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, although not frequently observed, have long been known. More recently there has been much interest in polar stratospheric clouds which had hitherto received little attention. Stratospheric cloud particles can be water-containing sulfuric acid droplets or solid nitric acid hydrates. Studies of the Antarctic ozone hole have revealed that these clouds are likely to play an important role in the depletion of ozone in the polar stratosphere., [Peter Brimblecombe Ph.D. ], Chamberlain, J. W., and D. M. Hunten. Theory of Planetary Atmospheres. New York: Academic Press, 1987.,
