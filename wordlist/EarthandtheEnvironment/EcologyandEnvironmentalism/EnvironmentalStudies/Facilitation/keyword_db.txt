[Facilitation refers to the repeated passage of an excitation along the same pathway; this brings about a gradual and permanent decrease in resistance to this progression, and thus this channel develops into the preferred pathway for future excitations., This term was used very early by Sigmund Freud (1888r, 1892g, 1893k). In the first article, Freud contrasts "facilitation and inhibition" to "reflex" and, in the two other articles, he separates "facilitation" and
"inhibition" as the two modes of reflex transmission. The maximal usage of the term, as defined above, is found in Freud's 1895 "Project for a Scientific Psychology," with its neurological model of mental functioning., Josef Breuer, in the Studies on Hysteria (1895), mentions the "attentional facilitation" invoked by Sigmund Exner (1894), who was dealing with the problem of energy and considered attentional facilitation to be pathological. In the "Project for a Scientific Psychology," Freud reworked the same notion differently to describe learning operations at the level of the "w neurons"and the memory, which tends to establish a type of operations similar to those of the ψ system governed by the principle of inertia. In this text, facilitation is conceived as a sort of double of the process of cathexis, the other important element in the management of bound energy., , Subsequently, Freud all but abandoned the term facilitation, which he uses only three times in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900a), where he opposes it to "resistance," and a final time in "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" (1920g), where facilitation is defined as a "permanent trace of the excitation" (p. 26) obtained through a decrease in the resistance against the progression of excitation., Bertrand Vichyn, See also: Binding/unbinding of the instincts; Hypercathexis; "Project for a Scientific Psychology"; Psi system; Signifier; Signifying chain., Breuer, Josef, and Sigmund Freud (1895d).
