[If asked to picture a scientist, most people probably would imagine a professional peering into a microscope or poring over statistics on a computer screen. Science does not belong solely to such professionals, however. Ordinary citizens from all walks of life have a huge stake in science and technology as well, which can both enrich their lives with new discoveries and damage their world with pollution. Citizen science is a movement that recognizes the contribution which such concerned citizens can make to scientific policy and research, particularly when it comes to environmental issues., Several high-profile court cases have proved the power of citizen science. For example, it was citizen volunteers in Woburn, Massachusetts, who gathered data about the unusually large number of area children stricken with leukemia, a cancer of the blood-forming cells. The efforts of these volunteers led to a trial, where two large corporations were accused of polluting the town's water, which was thought to have played a role in the children's illness. The trial, in turn, inspired a best-selling book by Jonathan Harr and a popular movie starring John Travolta, both titled A Civil Action. , , Another famous example of citizen science is less controversial, but just as powerful in its own way. In 1900 the National Audubon Society launched its Christmas Day Bird Count, in which amateur birdwatchers were asked to tally and report the number of birds they spotted on one day. The first year, twenty-seven people took part. Today, this event, the longest-running of all citizen science projects, attracts more than 50,000 participants. Several other large-scale bird counts have started as well. These projects help scientists spot local changes in bird populations, which may signal an environmental threat, such as groundwater pollution or poisoning from the improper use of pesticides., Some citizen science programs enlist people of all ages to help with the hands-on collection of technical data. For example, Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) is a program that has involved more than one million elementary through high school students in the United States and one hundred other countries. The students learn to take accurate measurements of the air, water, soil, and vegetation in their area. They then share their data via the Internet. Scientists, in turn, use the measurements to improve their understanding of the global environment., Although GLOBE is sponsored by the U.S. government, many citizen science programs grow out of grassroots organizations. For example, it is estimated that over 550,000 people in the United States are involved in monitoring rivers in their area. The River Watch Program is a national organization that provides training and support to local groups working to protect and restore their rivers. As these examples show, individuals do not need lab coats, fancy equipment, or a big research budget to make very real and important contributions to environmental science., see also

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Becoming a Citizen Scientist, according to the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology, can be as simple as glancing periodically at your backyard bird feeder, or as complicated as getting out in the field, collecting data about the relationship between an environments characteristics and the success of bird-nesting in that milieu. Put simply, citizen science is the practice of involving individual citizens, through their voluntary efforts, in the work of environmental science . Such voluntary assistance encompasses a wide variety of environmentally-related issues and projects, including the counting of various species of bird, monitoring rainfall amounts, or observing and surveying the habits of threatened species of wildlife . The goal of all environmental science, whether performed by private citizens or environmental scientists, is the same: to provide for the health of the planet, its natural resources , and all living beings., John Fein, an internationally-renowned science educator, and associate professor at Griffith University (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia ), described this participatory process as one that can "bridge the gap between science and the community and between scientific research and policy, decision-making and planning." "Bridging these gaps," he went on to note, "involves a process of social learning through sound environmental research, full public participation, the adoption of adaptive management practices and the development of the democratic values, skills and institutions for an active civil society.", , In the United States, citizen science began in the 1800s, and became more formalized in 1886, when the National Audubon Society was created. According to its preamble, the societys aim was to: promote the conservation of wildlife and the natural environment, and educate man regarding his relationship with, and place within, the natural environment as an ecological system. Public awareness of environmental concerns increased with the first Earth Day in 1970. The significance of Earth Day has served as a reminder to the world community that it is not only the scientists who are responsible for the health of the environment . The general public, each individual, has been given the challenge to take measures large or small that might add up to an enormous improvement in the ecological scheme of life., Today there are so many citizen science projects initiated by various environmental organizations that it would be impossible to list all of them. However, some of the better known include:, Citizen science projects such as these have provided information used in decision-making resulting in the purchasing of lands that host certain threatened species during breeding time and the development of bird population management guidelines. Further, data obtained from these surveys is often published in scientific and educational journals., The "explosion" of popularity and participation in citizen science has been a welcome development. Both the United Nations and individual national governments have become involved, sponsoring events such as the planned 2002 U.N. global summit scheduled for Johannesburg, South Africa, between August 26th and September 4th, 2002 to examine poverty, development, and the environment., , For citizens unaware of environmental issues, it appears that more information and publicity is necessary. In an article for the Environmental News Network (ENN) in October 2001, Erica Gies states, "As a person who cares about environmental issues, I often find myself preaching to the choir. But when I have an opportunity to converse with people who are either uninformed or inclined to disagree, it can be difficult to communicate my passion effectively without alienating them, especially if they are people I have a long history with, such as family." To attain that goal of increasing awareness, Gies suggests using art, literature and the media. There are a variety of nonfiction books and essays, poetry; art, and music featuring environmental or nature themes, as well as the films focusing on environmental issues featured each spring at an Environmental Film Festival held in Washington, D.C. But even a comic strip can give an ecological focus. Gies quotes Dilbert creator, Scott Adams from his book, The Dilbert Future irreverently noting that, "The children are our future. And that is why, ultimately, we're screwed unless we do something about it. If you haven't noticed, the children who are our future are good looking but they aren't all that bright. As dense as they might be, they will eventually notice that adults have spent all the money, spread disease, and turned the planet into a smoky, filthy ball of death." , David Suzuki also offered his insights into the challenges facing the environment in an article for ENN in June 2002. Enumerating the biggest challenges for the environment in the next century, Suzuki noted, "I'm beginning to think one of the biggest challenges is overcoming the fact that people are tired of all the depressing news about the environment." Citizen science was offering a solution for positive approaches and answers to these issues, giving the public a reason to be hopeful and cherish their involvement in seeing things change. One such person, Robert Boyle, of Cold Spring, NY and author of the 1969 book, The Hudson River: A Natural and Unnatural History continued his struggle for 30 years after the publication of his book alerting people to the decay of the Hudson River . His book was the waterways equivalent of the Silent Spring (Rachel Carson's book that alerted the public to the danger of pesticides and was responsible for much of the environmental movement of the 1960s). Boyles book was instrumental in beginning the process of cleaning up not only the Hudson River, but all other polluted waterways across the United States. In 2002, Boyle continued to fight major industrial polluters and the government in courts in his effort to preserve the natural bounty of the Hudson River., [Joan M.
