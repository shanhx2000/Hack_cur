The fly is presented to the fish first without any disturbances from the leader or line. When the casting planes are made away from the fish’s location, the fish are undisturbed by overhead false casting and line spray. Many times fish are wary of overhead motions which may simulate birds of prey. Additionally, the downstream presentation is simple and effective; perhaps its only disadvantage is that the fly needs to be accurately cast.,
