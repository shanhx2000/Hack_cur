Autecology includes the study of the life history and/or behavior of a particular species in relation to the environmental conditions that influence its activities and distribution. Autecology also includes studies on the tolerance of a species to critical physical factors (e.g., temperature, salinity , oxygen level, light) and biological factors (e.g., predation, symbiosis ) thought to limit its distribution. Such data are gathered from field measurement or from controlled experiments in the laboratory. Autecology contrasts with synecology, the study of interacting groups (i.e., communities) of species.,
