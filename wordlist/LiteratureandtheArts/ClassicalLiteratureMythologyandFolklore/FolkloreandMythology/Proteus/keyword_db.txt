[Proteus was an ancient Greek god also known as the old man of the sea. He served as a shepherd for the sea god Neptune*, watching over his flocks of seals. In return, Neptune gave Proteus the gift of prophecy. , prophecy foretelling of what is to come; also something that is predicted, Proteus possessed knowledge of all things—past, present, and future—but was reluctant to reveal his knowledge. He would answer questions only if caught. The only way to catch him was to sneak up on him at noontime when he took his daily nap. However, Proteus also had the ability to change shape at will. Once he was seized, it was necessary to hold him tightly until he returned to his natural form. Then he would answer any question put to him. The legend of Proteus gave rise to the term protean, which means able to assume different forms., See also  Greek Mythology;

He served as a shepherd for the sea god Poseidon (pronounced poh-SYE-dun), who is sometimes named as his father. Proteus watched over Poseidon's flocks of seals, and in return, Poseidon gave Proteus the gift of prophecy, or the ability to see the future., Proteus possessed knowledge of all things—past, present, and future— but was reluctant to reveal his knowledge. He would answer questions only if caught. The only way to catch him was to sneak up on him at noontime when he took his daily nap. However, Proteus also had the ability to change shape at will. Once he was seized, it was necessary to hold him tightly until he returned to his natural form. Then he would answer any question put to him., According to one myth, Aristaeus (pronounced a-ris-TEE-uhs), a son of the god Apollo (pronounced uh-POL-oh) and a beekeeper, discovered one day that all of his bees had died from an unknown sickness. His mother suggested that he locate Proteus, who would know how to solve his bee problem. Aristaeus found Proteus and held on tight to him, despite his attempts to change shape and escape. Eventually Proteus gave up and agreed to answer whatever question Aristaeus might ask. Aristaeus asked how to get back his bees; Proteus told him to sacrifice twelve animals at an altar, and return to the altar after three days. When Aristaeus returned to the altar, the corpse of one of the animals was filled with bees. Aristaeus kept these bees, and they never again fell ill., The idea of Proteus, a sea god, may reflect ancient Greek observations about the nature of the sea. Many observers throughout the centuries have noted the constantly changing nature of the sea, with its ever-shifting surface and ability to turn from calm to violent very quickly. Proteus may also reflect an ancient view of the gods as often being unwilling to help others, especially humans., One of the main themes found in the myth of Proteus is the reluctant seer—a being who possesses great knowledge, but is unwilling to share it except when forced. Proteus never offers his wisdom willingly, as shown in the myth of Aristaeus and the bees. Another theme is ancient wisdom: although Proteus was often referred to as the son of Poseidon, he was always pictured as an old man, and it was rumored he existed in myth long before many of the Olympian gods., The legend of Proteus gave rise to the term protean, which means able to assume different forms. Although Proteus seldom appears as a character in art or literature after ancient times, he has been mentioned in the works of John Milton, William Shakespeare, and William Wordsworth, and the concept of Proteus as a shape-shifter has endured both literally and figuratively. Kurt Vonnegut gave the main character of his novel Player Piano (1952) the last name of Proteus, a reference to his shifting identity. Proteus, and shape-shifting creatures known as Proteans, appear often in role-playing games such as Vampire: The Masquerade. Proteus is also the name given to a satellite of the planet Neptune., The term “protean” is used to refer not only to beings that can change shape, but also to people who can exhibit different moods or personalities in different situations. In modern times, such people might be classified as having a mood or personality disorder. Looking at the actions and behaviors of the other Greek gods, how do you think they would be viewed by modern people? Why? Provide examples to illustrate your point., SEE ALSO Greek Mythology; Poseidon,
