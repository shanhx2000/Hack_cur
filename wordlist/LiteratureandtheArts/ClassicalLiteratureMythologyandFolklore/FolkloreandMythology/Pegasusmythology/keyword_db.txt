[A winged horse in Greek mythology, Pegasus was supposedly the offspring of the sea god Poseidon and the Gorgon Medusa. According to legend, Pegasus was born from the blood that spurted from Medusa's neck when the hero Perseus killed her. Pegasus served Perseus until his death and afterward went to the home of the Muses. The water that gave the Muses their inspiration had dried up, so Pegasus stamped his hoof and created a spring., Gorgon one of three ugly monsters who had snakes for hair, staring eyes, and huge wings, Muse one of nine sister goddesses who presided over the arts and sciences, With the help of the goddess Athena*, the hero Bellerophon later tamed Pegasus and rode the horse when he slew the monster called the Chimaera. Later Bellerophon tried to ride Pegasus to the top of Mount Olympus* so that he could join the Greek gods. However, Zeus* caused a fly to bite Pegasus, and the horse threw Bellerophon to earth, crippling him for life., See also  Bellerophon;
