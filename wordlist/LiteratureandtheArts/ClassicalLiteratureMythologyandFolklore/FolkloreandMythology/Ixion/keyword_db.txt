[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Ixion (Ĭk´sēən), in Greek mythology, king of the Lapithes. Ixion murdered his father-in-law to avoid paying a price for his bride. When no one on earth would purify him, Zeus took Ixion to Olympus and purified him. While there Ixion attempted to seduce Hera, but Zeus created a phantom of her and by it Ixion became the father of the centaurs. As punishment for his impious act, Ixion was chained eternally to a revolving, fiery wheel in Tartarus.,
