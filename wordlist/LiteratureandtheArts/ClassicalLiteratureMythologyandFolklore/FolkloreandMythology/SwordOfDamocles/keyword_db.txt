[Damocles was a member of the court of Dionysius, ruler of the Sicilian city of Syracuse during the 300s b.c. According to a legend passed on by the Roman writer Cicero, Damocles told Dionysius how much he envied his kingly wealth, power, and happiness. In response, Dionysius invited Damocles to come to a magnificent banquet., imminent about to take place; threatening, Damocles was seated before a marvelous feast, when he happened to glance up in horror. Above his head hung a sharp sword, suspended by nothing more than a single thread. In this way, Dionysius showed Damocles that a ruler's life may appear grand, but it is filled with uncertainty and danger. The "sword of Damocles" has thus come to symbolize imminent danger.,

In response, Dionysius invited Damocles to come to a magnificent banquet., Damocles was seated before a marvelous feast, enjoying the benefits of a ruler, when he happened to glance up in horror. Above his head hung a sharp sword, suspended by nothing more than a single thread. Damocles was no longer able to enjoy the food, wine, or entertainment before him. In this way, Dionysius showed Damocles that a ruler's life may appear grand, but it is filled with uncertainty and danger., Although Damocles appears to be a work of legend, Dionysius the Younger was an actual ruler in fourth-century Sicily. He originally ruled under the guidance of his uncle Dion and his uncle's teacher, the philosopher Plato, but Dionysius grew tired of what he viewed as their attempts to control him. He drove his uncle out of Syracuse, but after years of his unpopular rule, his uncle amassed an army and returned to take over the city. Dionysius fled, and years after his uncle died, returned to reclaim leadership of Syracuse. Still unpopular, he was driven out once again, and lived the last years of his life in Corinth, Greece., The real-life events of Dionysius the Younger help to illustrate the message of the legend of Damocles: though he ruled Syracuse twice, it is not likely he enjoyed much peace or satisfaction as its leader. Few kings in ancient cultures did. Positions of power were often gained, maintained, or lost by force., One of the key themes of the tale of Damocles is that one should not be envious of another person's position. Although they may appear to have a perfect life, they may also bear burdens that cannot be seen. The “sword of Damocles” symbolizes a threat that can come to pass at any moment; for Dionysius, the sword represented the threat of murder or betrayal by his own followers., The legend of Damocles has endured as a popular tale for centuries. The climax of the tale is famously depicted in Richard WestalPs 1812 painting Sword of Damocles. In modern usage, the phrase “sword of Damocles” is commonly used to refer to a potentially tragic threat or situation that seems inches away., Because of their unprecedented destructive power, nuclear weapons have been described as a sword of Damocles hanging over modern civilization. Others have argued that nuclear weapons are necessary to keep some nations from attacking peaceful countries without provocation. Do you think nuclear weapons are a necessary enforcement tool or a potentially tragic threat? Can they be both? Explain your opinion.,
