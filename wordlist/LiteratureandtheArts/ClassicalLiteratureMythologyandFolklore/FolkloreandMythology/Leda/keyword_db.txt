[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Leda (lē´də), in Greek mythology, daughter of Thestios, king of Aetolia, and wife of Tyndareus, king of Sparta. According to most legends, she was seduced by Zeus, who visited her in the form of a swan. She bore two eggs; from one issued Castor and Pollux, from the other Helen (and, in some myths, Clytemnestra). Castor and Clytemnestra, however, are usually said to be the offspring of Tyndareus.,
