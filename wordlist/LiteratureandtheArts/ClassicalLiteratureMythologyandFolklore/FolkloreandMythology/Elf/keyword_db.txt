, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, As a baby, Buddy (Ferrell) had snuck into Santa's bag and found himself transported to the North Pole. The elves adopted the human and raised him as an elf. When he learns of his human origins (the enormous size difference didn't tip him off?), he goes to New York to search for his real father. Daddy turns out to be a Walter Hobbs (Caan), a highly insensitive children's book publisher who needs a good dose of Christmas cheer. While it's all straight-ahead Christmas movie formula, Ferrell's unabashed innocence and delight in everything helps pull it off. It also helps that he looks so darn funny in yellow tights. Director Favreau makes a cameo as a doctor. 95m/C VHS, DVD, UMD .
