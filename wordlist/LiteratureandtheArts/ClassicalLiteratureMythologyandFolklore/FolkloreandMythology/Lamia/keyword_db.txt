, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, In ancient Greek folklore, Lamia was a shape-shifting monster that sucked blood and ate flesh, similar to stories of the succubus and vampire. Lamia, the daughter of Belus and Libya, was loved by Zeus and punished by Hera. Because Hera took Lamia's children away, Lamia took her revenge on the children of men and women, since she had no power over gods. Lamia became transformed into a class of demonic being in Greek lore, the lamiai. According to folk beliefs, the lamiai might be in the form of a beautiful woman, a snake with a woman's head, or a monster with deformed lower limbs and the power to take out her eyes., (See also Striges ), Lawson, John Cuthbert.
