[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Oedipus (ĕd´Ĭpəs, ē´dĬ–), in Greek legend, son of Laius, king of Thebes, and his wife, Jocasta. Laius had been warned by an oracle that he was fated to be killed by his own son; he therefore abandoned Oedipus on a mountainside. The baby was rescued, however, by a shepherd and brought to the king of Corinth, who adopted him. When Oedipus was grown, he learned from the Delphic oracle that he would kill his father and marry his mother. He fled Corinth to escape this fate, believing his foster parents to be his real parents. At a crossroad he encountered Laius, quarreled with him, and killed him. He continued on to Thebes, where the sphinx was killing all who could not solve her riddle. Oedipus answered it correctly and so won the widowed queen's hand. The prophecy was thus fulfilled. Two sons, Polynices and Eteocles, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene, were born to the unwittingly incestuous pair. When a plague descended on Thebes, an oracle declared that the only way to rid the land of its pollution was to expel the murderer of Laius. Through a series of painful revelations, brilliantly dramatized by Sophocles in Oedipus Rex, the king learned the truth and in an agony of horror blinded himself. According to Homer, Oedipus continued to reign over Thebes until he was killed in battle; but the more common version is that he was exiled by Creon, Jocasta's brother, and his sons battled for the throne (see Seven against Thebes). In Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus, Oedipus is guided in his later wanderings by his faithful daughter, Antigone.,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Oedipus was a tragic hero of Greek mythology, a king doomed to a dire fate because he unknowingly killed his father and married his mother. His story is the tale of someone who, because he did not know his true identity, followed the wrong path in life. Once he had set foot on that path, his best qualities could not save him from the results of actions that violated the laws of gods and men. Oedipus represents two enduring themes of Greek myth and drama: the flawed nature of humanity and an individual's powerlessness against the course of destiny in a harsh universe., The Myth. The story begins with a son born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta of Thebes*. The oracle at Delphi* told them that their child would grow up to murder Laius and marry Jocasta. Horrified, the king fastened the infant's feet together with a large pin and left him on a mountainside to die., , However, shepherds found the baby—who became known as Oedipus, or "swollen foot"—and took him to the city of Corinth. There King Polybus and Queen Merope adopted him and raised him to think that he was their own son. When Oedipus was grown, however, someone told him that he was not the son of Polybus. Oedipus went to Delphi to ask the oracle about his parentage. The answer he received was, "You are the man fated to murder his father and marry his mother.", Like Laius and Jocasta, Oedipus was determined to avoid the destiny predicted for him. Believing that the oracle had said he was fated to kill Polybus and marry Merope, he vowed never to return to Corinth. Instead, he headed toward Thebes., oracle priest or priestess or other creature through whom a god is believed to speak; also the location (such as a shrine) where such words are spoken, destiny future or fate of an individual or thing, Along the way, Oedipus came to a narrow road between cliffs. There he met an older man in a chariot coming the other way. The two quarreled over who should give way, and Oedipus killed the stranger and went on to Thebes. He found the city in great distress. He learned that a monster called the Sphinx was terrorizing the Thebans by devouring them when they failed to answer its riddle and that King Laius had been murdered on his way to seek help from the Delphic oracle. The riddle of the Sphinx was "What walks on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening?" Oedipus gave the correct answer: "A human being, who crawls as an infant, walks erect in maturity, and leans on a staff in old age." With this answer, Oedipus not only defeated the Sphinx, which killed itself in rage, but won the throne of the dead king and the hand in marriage of the king's widow, Jocasta., * See Names and Places at the end of this volume for further information. , Oedipus and Jocasta lived happily for a time and had two sons and two daughters. Then a dreadful plague came upon Thebes. A prophet declared that the plague would not end until the Thebans drove out the murderer of Laius, who was within the city. A messenger then arrived from Corinth, announcing the death of King Polybus and asking Oedipus to return and rule the Corinthians. Oedipus told Jocasta what the oracle had predicted for him and expressed relief that the danger of his murdering Polybus was past. Jocasta told him not to fear oracles, for the oracle had said that her first husband would be killed by his own son, and instead he had been murdered by a stranger on the road to Delphi., , Suddenly Oedipus remembered that fatal encounter on the road and knew that he had met and killed his real father, Laius. At the same time, Jocasta realized that the scars on Oedipus's feet marked him as the baby whose feet Laius had pinned together so long ago. Faced with the fact that she had married her own son and the murderer of Laius, she hanged herself. Oedipus seized a pin from her dress and blinded himself with it., Some accounts say that Oedipus was banished at once from Thebes, while others relate that he lived a miserable existence there, despised by all, until his children grew up. Eventually he was driven into exile, accompanied by his two daughters, Antigone and Ismene. After years of lonely wandering, he arrived in Athens, where he found refuge in a grove of trees called Colonus. By this time, warring factions in Thebes wanted him to return to that city, believing that his body would bring it luck. However, Oedipus died at Colonus, and the presence of his grave there was said to bring good fortune to Athens., Legacy. Thus runs the best-known account of the myth of Oedipus, preserved in Oedipus the King and Oedipus at Colonus, two dramas by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles. Most versions of the story have followed the pattern that Sophocles set down, although an earlier version, mentioned by Homer in the Greek epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, says that after Oedipus's identity was revealed, Jocasta hanged herself. Oedipus, however, continued to rule Thebes, died in battle, and was buried with honor., prophet one who claims to have received divine messages or insights, epic long poem about legendary or historical heroes, written in a grand style, The story of Oedipus has inspired artists and thinkers since ancient times. The Roman philosopher Seneca wrote a tragedy entitled Oedipus that influenced writers such as England's John Dryden and Alexander Pope and France's Voltaire and Pierre Corneille. Later artistic treatments of the Oedipus story include a translation of Sophocles' work by Irish poet William Butler Yeats, a play entitled The Infernal Machine by Jean Cocteau of France, music by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, and the movie Oedipus Rex by Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini. Sigmund Freud, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, used the term Oedipus complex to refer to a psychological state in which boys or men experience hostility toward their fathers and are attracted to their mothers., See also  Antigone;

His story is the tale of someone who, because he did not know his true identity, followed the wrong path in life. Once he had set foot on that path, his best qualities could not save him from the results of actions that violated the laws of gods and men., Oedipus was born to King Laius (pronounced LAY-uhs) and Queen Jocasta (pronounced joh-KAS-tuh) of Thebes (pronounced THEEBZ). The oracle at Delphi (pronounced DEL-fye), who could communicate direcdy with the gods, told Laius and Jocasta that their child would grow up to murder Laius and marry Jocasta.

After years of lonely wandering, he arrived in Athens, where he found refuge in a grove of trees called Colonus. By this time, warring factions in Thebes wanted him to return to that city, believing that his body would bring it luck. Oedipus, however, died at Colonus, and the presence of his grave there was said to bring good fortune to Athens., The tale of Oedipus reflects and reinforces ancient Greek traditions and values in more than one way. First, the myth emphasizes the importance of following traditions related to family members. The idea of killing a relative was shocking to ancient Greeks and was considered so serious that it was beyond the scope of punishment by human laws. Similarly, marrying one's own parent went against the most basic marriage traditions in Greek culture (and most other cultures). By showing how these unspeakable acts led to a tragic end for Oedipus, the myth reinforced these traditions among the ancient Greeks who knew the tale. The myth also reflects cultural beliefs about destiny, or the idea that future events in a person's life are already determined and cannot be changed. For the ancient Greeks, who consulted with messengers of the gods regularly, this was a widely accepted notion. The abundance of such stories in Greek myth—as opposed to stories where characters successfully defy the gods and change their destinies—indicates that the ideas of freedom and free will were much more limited in scope than they are in modern society. Stories like the myth of Oedipus would instead encourage citizens to accept their destiny, whatever it may be., The story of Oedipus contains two enduring themes of Greek myth and drama: the flawed nature of humanity, and an individual's powerlessness against the course of destiny. Laius and Oedipus are both flawed because of their arrogance or overconfidence. Not only do they both believe they can defy the predictions of the oracles, but neither is willing to grant the other first passage when they meet on the road between the cliffs. This results in Oedipus killing Laius, therefore fulfilling the first part of the prophecy. This inability to escape destiny is also shown in Oedipus's flight from Corinth; Oedipus believes he is safe from the prediction of the oracle, even though his actions directly result in the prediction coming true. The fact that Oedipus blinds himself is symbolic of the arrogance that blinded him to the destiny he thought he could escape., The best-known account of the myth of Oedipus is preserved in Oedipus the King and Oedipus at Colonus, two dramas by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles. Most versions of the story have followed the pattern that Sophocles set down, although an earlier version, mentioned by Homer in the Greek epics the Iliad and the Odyssey , says that after Oedipus's identity was revealed, Jocasta hanged herself. Oedipus, however, continued to rule Thebes, died in battle, and was buried with honor., The story of Oedipus has inspired artists and thinkers since ancient times.

Later artistic treatments of the Oedipus story include a translation of Sophocles' work by Irish poet William Butler Yeats; a play entitled The Infernal Machine by Jean Cocteau of France; music by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky; and the movie Oedipus Rex by Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini. Sigmund Freud, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, used the term Oedipus complex to refer to a psychological state in which a boy or man experiences hostility toward his father due to an inappropriate attraction or bond to his mother., Oedipus commits two unspeakable acts—killing his father and marrying his mother—without knowing he has done either one. In modern law, if a person commits a crime without knowing that it was illegal, the person can still be held accountable for committing the crime. At the same time, many laws differ from state to state or even city to city, with some cities still carrying old laws that might seem silly to modern visitors (in Gainesville, Georgia, for example, it is technically illegal to eat chicken with a fork). Do you think not knowing about a law is ever a valid defense for breaking that law? Why or why not?, SEE ALSO Antigone; Greek Mythology; Sphinx,
