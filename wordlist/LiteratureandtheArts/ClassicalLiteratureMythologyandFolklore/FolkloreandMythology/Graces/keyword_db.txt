[In Greek and Roman mythology the Graces (or Charites) were minor goddesses who symbolized beauty charm, and goodness. The number of Graces varied, though most myths included three sisters: Aglaia (brightness or splendor), Thalia (good cheer or blossoming one), and Euphrosyne (mirth or joyfulness). Other Graces sometimes mentioned were Cleta (sound), Pasithea (shining), and Peitho (persuasion)., According to most stories, the Graces were the children of Zeus* and Eurynome, a daughter of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys. In some myths, however, the Graces' parents were Zeus and Hera*. The Graces always appeared as a group rather than as separate individuals. They were also frequently linked with the Muses, another group of female goddesses., , The main role of the Graces was to bestow beauty, charm, and goodness on young women and to give joy to people in general. They were usually associated with Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and appeared among the attendants of the gods Apollo*, Dionysus*, and Hermes*. They entertained the gods by dancing to the music of Apollo's lyre. At times, the Graces were considered patrons of music, dance, and poetry., The Graces provided inspiration to artists throughout the centuries. Most works of art portray them with their hands entwined and their bodies either nude or partially draped with flowing robes. One of the most famous paintings of the Graces is Primavera by Botticelli, an Italian artist of the late 1400s., See also

The number of Graces varied, though most myths included three sisters: Aglaia (pronounced uh-GLAY-uh; “brightness” or “splendor”), Thalia (pronounced thuh-LYE-uh; “good cheer” or “blossoming one”), and Euphrosyne (pronounced yoo-FROS-uh-nee; “mirth” or “joyfulness”). Other Graces sometimes mentioned were Cleta (pronounced KLEE-tuh; “sound”), Pasithea (pronounced puh-SITH-ee-uh; “shining”), and Peitho (pronounced PYE-tho; “persuasion”)., According to most stories, the Graces were the children of Zeus (pronounced ZOOS) and Eurynome (pronounced yoo-RIN-uh-mee), a daughter of the Titans Oceanus (pronounced oh-SEE-uh-nuhs) and Tethys (pronounced TEE-this).

They entertained the gods by dancing to the music of Apollo's lyre, an ancient stringed musical instrument. At times, the Graces were considered the official goddesses of music, dance, and poetry., The Graces were meant to embody the characteristics that ancient Greeks considered attractive in young women. The ideal young woman was not only beautiful, but also a source of good cheer and brightness of spirit. Girls were expected to never show an ill mood, because it was considered an ugly quality that would repel any possible suitors., The Graces represent beauty, joy, and the arts. They also symbolize the way in which beauty and happiness were considered to be fundamentally connected by the ancient Greeks, as the Graces are always shown together and usually holding hands. They are also seen as symbols of youth, creativity, and fertility., The Graces provided inspiration to artists throughout the centuries. Most works of art portray them with their hands entwined and their bodies either nude or partially draped with flowing robes. The Graces have been painted by Raphael, Rubens, and Paul Cezanne among others, and appear in a well-known sculpture by Antonio Canova. One of the most famous paintings of the Graces is Primavera by Sandro Botticelli, an Italian artist of the late 1400s., In ancient Greece, the Graces functioned as role models for young women, offering an example of ideal behaviors and qualities. What qualities do you think the most popular modern role models for young women exhibit? How do they compare to the qualities of the Graces? Which do you think provides a better example to follow, and why?, SEE ALSO Apollo; Greek Mythology; Muses; Roman Mythology,
