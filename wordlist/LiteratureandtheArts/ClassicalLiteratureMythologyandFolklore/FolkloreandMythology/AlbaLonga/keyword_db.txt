[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Alba Longa (ăl´bə lông´gə), city of ancient Latium, in the Alban Hills near Lake Albano, c.12 mi (19 km) SE of Rome. It was a city before 1100 BC and apparently the most powerful in Latium. Legend says that it was founded by Ascanius, son of Aeneas, and that Romulus and Remus were born there, thus making it the mother city of Rome. Tradition also says that Tullus Hostilius, king of Rome, razed it in 665 BC Possibly Rome was founded from Alba Longa, and certainly the Romans destroyed it (c.600 BC). The modern Castel Gandolfo occupies the site.,
