[Also known as the "abominable snowman," the yeti is the mysterious humanoid creature reported by Western sources as early as 1832 as living in the Himalayan Mountains. It became well known following several expeditions to the area in the 1950s. In 1960 Sir Edmund Hillary, who conquered Everest, called further attention to the yeti in his attempts to debunk them. The Soviet Ministry of Culture established a group of "cryptozoologists" to locate the yeti, according to a report of January 9, 1988, by Tass, the Soviet press agency. The agency stated that nearly one hundred sightings had been collated by Zhanna Kofman of Moscow., Clark, Jerome. Encyclopedia of Strange and Unexplained Phenomena.
