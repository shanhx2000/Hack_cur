, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, The sea nymphs of Greek mythology whose hypnotically sweet song lured mariners to their deaths. The island of the sirens had a meadow strewn with the bones of the victims of these deadly nymphs. In Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus has to steer his vessel past the island and takes the precaution of having his men fill their ears with wax to avoid hearing the siren song, while he himself is lashed to the vessel's mast. Jason and his band of heroes also had to sail past that island, but Orpheus sang so sweetly that he drowned out the song of the sirens. After Orpheus's song vanquished them, the sirens sprang into the sea and became rocks., The sirens, two or three in number, were said to be the off-spring of Phorcys or Achelous, and were part women, part birds. Some believed they were unhappy souls of the dead, envious of the living. The modern story of the Lorelei has something in common with the myths of the sirens.,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, The Sirens were female creatures from Greek mythology whose singing lured men to destruction. Descriptions of the Sirens vary from beautiful women to monsters with the bodies of birds and human heads., The Sirens lived on an island where they enchanted passing sailors with their song. According to some sources, sailors died when their ships crashed on the rocks near the island. Others say that sailors stayed on the island and listened to the singing until they died., Only on two occasions did the Sirens fail to enchant passing sailors. When Jason* and the Argonauts were searching for the
Golden Fleece, Orpheus* sang so sweetly that none of the crew listened to the Sirens. In Homer's* epic the Odyssey, the hero Odysseus* made his men put wax in their ears so that they could not hear the Sirens. Wanting to hear their song, Odysseus had the crew tie him to the mast so that he could not steer the ship toward the island. Some stories say the Sirens were so enraged by Odysseus that they drowned themselves in the sea., See also  Argonauts;
