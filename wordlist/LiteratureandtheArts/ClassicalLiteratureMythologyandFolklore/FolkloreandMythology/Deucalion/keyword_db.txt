[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Deucalion (dyōōkā´lēən), in Greek mythology, son of Prometheus and father of Hellen. When Zeus, angered by humanity's irreverence, flooded the earth, Deucalion, warned by Prometheus, survived by taking refuge with his wife, Pyrrha, in an ark. Later, an oracle told them to cast behind them the bones of their mother (i.e., the stones of the earth). From these stones sprang men and women who repopulated the world.,
