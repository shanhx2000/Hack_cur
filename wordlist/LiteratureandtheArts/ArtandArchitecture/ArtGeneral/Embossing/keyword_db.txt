[Copyright The Columbia University Press, embossing, process of producing upon various materials designs or patterns in relief by mechanical means. The material is pressed between a pair of dies especially adapted to its hardness and the depth of the design needed. A felt counter or female die is employed for embossing fabrics, while metal, millboard, or cardboard is used for embossing metal, cardboard, or paper. Leather for bookbinding and wood for furniture ornamentation are die stamped while wet. Embossing differs from other relief design processes, such as repoussé, chasing, carving, and leather tooling, in being machine wrought.,
