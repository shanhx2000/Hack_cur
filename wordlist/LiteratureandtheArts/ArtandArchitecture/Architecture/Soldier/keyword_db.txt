Genetically engineered soldier Russell is discarded as obsolete on a garbage dump planet inhabited by a freedom-loving survivalist (Pertwee) and his band of human flotsam. When a force led by next-generation soldier Jason Scott Lee invades the planet, Russell helps save the skankylooking group of squatters. Robbed of his Snake Plissken smirk, Russell delivers a hollow character who is hard to like. The garbage planet set recycles props used in “Demolition Man,” “Executive Decision,” and “Event Horizon.” The movie recycles ideas from every other sci-fi flick. 99m/C VHS, DVD .
