[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Regency style, in English architecture, flourished during the regency and reign of George IV (1811–30) and was chiefly represented by the court architect John Nash. The period is characterized by the diversity of the architectural styles of many countries and periods. For the prince regent, John Nash constructed at Brighton the Royal Pavilion (1815–22) in the Indian style; it included exotic furnishings. The preponderant trend, however, was neoclassical, as seen in the works of Sir John Soane and George Dance II and in the rigid geometric order of Nash's design for Regent's Park in London. During this time stucco was often used on the exterior of buildings, and bay windows and balconies were in vogue. Furniture design was eclectic and showed the influence of Greek, Roman, Gothic, Egyptian, and Asian ornament.

The most important practitioners of the régence were Gilles Marie Oppenord and Robert de Cotte. In this period, curved lines and many motifs such as shells, masques, and sinuous foliated scrolls were introduced. These innovations were subsequently developed in rococo design. The legs of furniture took bulging outlines and the corners of panels were curved. The use of gilt bronze was extended, and walnut, rosewood, and other woods largely replaced ebony in veneers.,
