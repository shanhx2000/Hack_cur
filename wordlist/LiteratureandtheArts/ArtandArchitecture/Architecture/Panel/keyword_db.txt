(-eled
, -el·ing
;  Brit.  -elled, -el·ling) [tr.] [usu. as  adj.] (paneled)
cover (a wall or other surface) with panels:

ORIGIN: Middle English: from Old French, literally
‘piece of cloth,’ based on Latin pannus ‘(piece of) cloth.’ The early sense ‘piece of parchment’ was extended to mean ‘list,’ whence the notion ‘advisory group.’ Sense 1 derives from the late Middle English sense ‘distinct (usually framed) section of a surface.’
