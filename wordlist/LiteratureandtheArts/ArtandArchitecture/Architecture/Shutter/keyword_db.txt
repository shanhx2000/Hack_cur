New bride Jane (Taylor) joins her photographer husband Benjamin (Jackson) on a business trip to Japan. One foggy night the couple accidentally hit a girl in the road. They assume she's okay and life goes on. However, her ghostly image begins appearing in Benjamin's photographs, tormenting the couple.
