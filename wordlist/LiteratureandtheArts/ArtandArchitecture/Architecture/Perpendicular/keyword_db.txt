, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, The term perpendicular, in geometry, describes a pair of lines or planes that intersect each other at a 90-degree angle. Perpendicularity is an important concept in mathematics, science, engineering, and other fields. A line L1 is perpendicular to a line L2 if the two intersect with congruent adjacent angles, which means that the angles are both equal to 90 degrees. Of course, a purely analytical definition of the term exists, also. If one defines the slope m of a line as rise over run, then m = (y2 – y1)/(x2 – x1). A pair of non-vertical lines L1 and L2 are perpendicular if and only if m1m2 = -1., The concept of perpendicularity applies to any combination of lines and planes. Two or more planes can be perpendicular, or a line can be perpendicular to a plane, or to any number of parallel planes. Sometimes the term orthogonal is used with the same meaning, although orthogonal is also used outside of geometry and perpendicular is not. In science and engineering, a line perpendicular to another line or a plane is often referred to as being normal to the plane, or simply called the surface normal., The concept of perpendicularity is a fundamental building block of geometry. It allows mathematicians and scientists to define figures such as squares and parallelpipeds, for example, and to draw conclusions about the relationships of the angles in certain types of figures such as triangles. The common x-y or xyz coordinate system on which geometrical figures and scientific data are plotted is defined by a set of perpendicular, or orthogonal, lines. The right triangles from which mathematicians define most of the basic relationships of trigonometry are based on a pair of perpendicular lines. Analytical geometry and vector calculus, which are an indispensable tool in engineering and science, make continual use of the concept., Constructing a line perpendicular to another line is simple. Using a compass, measure equal distances both to the left (LL) and to the right (LR) of point P by putting the point of the compass on P and marking LL and L R. Then place the compass point on LL and scribe a short arc, then place the compass point on LR and find the arc that intercepts the first arc. The line that connects point P to intercept X is perpendicular to the original line L., Kristin Lewotsky,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Phalangers are a small group of arboreal mammals belonging to the family Phalangeridae, of which 26 species are recognized in six genera. Phalangers, more commonly known as possums and cuscuses, are marsupials but with a vague resemblance to some monkeys. Indeed many early European explorers thought that they were monkeys. These species occur in Australia, New Guinea and adjacent islands west to Sulawesi (Indonesia) and east to the Solomon Islands. New Guinea is thought to be the main center for evolution of these species with eight species represented. In addition to their natural range, some species have been introduced, such as the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula ) to New Zealand (for their valuable fur) and the common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis ) to the Solomon Islands., Phalangers are short, compact animals with thickly furred bodies. A wide range of colors occur from the predominantly reddish brown fur of the common cuscus to the pure white coat with dark spots of the spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus maculatus ) and the strikingly marked black-spotted cuscus (S. rufoniger ), the largest of all phalangers with a black back, orange-russet limbs, white underside and russet and white head. In most species the short ears are concealed by the thick fur. Their limbs are adapted to climbing, with sharp, curved claws for climbing and clawless, but opposable, first hind toes that assist with grasping small branches. They also have a strong prehensile tail, which is usually bare towards the tip. Phalangers aremost active at night— their large, forward-pointing eyes enable them to receive sufficient light to guide them through the tangle of branches and leaves in the forest canopy. A wide range of food items are taken, including young leaves, buds, shoots, fruit, and occasionally insects, birds eggs, and small lizards., Little is known about the social behavior of many of these species. Phalangers are probably capable of breeding throughout the year, but apart from when females are receptive to breeding, they all appear to be solitary animals, occupying a range of 7.5–20 acres (3–8 ha), depending on food, shelter and population density. In the wild, phalangers are relatively long-lived animals, with some living up to 13 years of age., Possums and cuscuses are well-known to humans—possums, in particular, for the economic damage they cause in timber plantations, as well as for their crop-raiding habits. In New Zealand, the damage caused to native vegetation has also been significant, as most of these trees evolved in the absence of foliage-feeding animals and are therefore unable to produce enough toxins to repel attack. It is also thought that the common brushtail may spread tuberculosis, which has led to a major eradication scheme of this species in New Zealand., As they rarely come down to the ground, possums and cuscuses have few natural predators, apart from large birds of prey and snakes. Human activities are thought to have had a major impact, at least on certain species, through habitat destruction which, in certain cases, is made worse by hunting pressure. Although the precise conservation status of most species is still uncertain, at least two species—the Telefomin cuscus (Phalanger matanim ) of Papua New Guinea and the black-spotted cuscus of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia—are considered endangered by the IUCN. These two species appear to be threatened by deforestation, habitat degradation, and, possibly, overhunting. Another species about which very little is known is the scaly-tailed possum (Wyulda squamicaudata )—the only species in its genus—known from northwestern Australia. In New Guinea, most species of cuscus are hunted for their meat and prized fur which is worn at special ceremonies. It is essential that appropriate conservation measures are taken to protect the native habitat of all of these species and to fully evaluate the extent of threats facing them from habitat loss and hunting.,
