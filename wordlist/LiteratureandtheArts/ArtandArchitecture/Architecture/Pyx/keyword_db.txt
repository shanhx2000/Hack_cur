, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, A container for the Blessed Sacrament. It was at first a small wooden box, usually round and with a lid. During the Middle Ages it was sometimes of metal or of ivory; when containing the Blessed Sacrament it was kept at first in people's houses, later in the sacristy, then on the altar, then suspended above the altar, sometimes inside a metal dove. When ambries, sacrament-houses, and tabernacles came into use for reserving the Blessed Sacrament, the pyx underwent a twofold development; by enlargement and the acquisition of a foot it developed into the ciborium by diminution in size and the addition of a hinged lid it became the small vessel now used for carrying a few consecrated hosts to the sick. Nowadays this is the meaning usually given to the word "pyx," though the name is used also for a similar vessel, a metal box that contains, inside the tabernacle, the large Host used for Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament., Bibliography: j. braun, Das christliche Altargerät in seinem Sein und in seiner Entwicklung (Munich 1932). c. rohault de fleury, La Messe, 8 v.
