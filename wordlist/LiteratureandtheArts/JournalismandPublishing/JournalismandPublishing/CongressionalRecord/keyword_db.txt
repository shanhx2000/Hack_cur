[CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, a daily, unofficial publication of the proceedings of the sessions of Congress. The Senate and House journals contain the official records. The Record prints not only the daily actions of each chamber but also a checked stenographic record of all remarks and formal debate. Congress has published this daily account of legislative action and opinion since 1873, before which three separate series of reports served a similar function. These three reports, Annals of Congress (1789–1824), Register of Debates (1824–1837), and Congressional Globe (1834–1873), were privately inspired and privately published with a consequently questionable accuracy., Amer, Mildred.
