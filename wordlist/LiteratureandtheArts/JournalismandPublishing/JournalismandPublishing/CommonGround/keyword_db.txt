[Common Ground (San Francisco) is the original New Age networking magazine founded in 1976 to provide contact between the groups and leaders in the then-emerging New Age community and the growing community of people who identified with the New Age vision of transformation of self and society. Common Ground pioneered a format that was soon adapted by many other New Age periodicals., Each issue of Common Ground is dominated by numerous dis-play advertisements that have been grouped into more than a dozen categories. Each ad follows a similar outline, with the name of the group or individual, a logo or picture, a description of services, and contact information. The common outline allows for alphabetizing and the creation of what amounts to a yellow pages of services available in the community. The reader can easily locate spiritual groups, psychological therapists, vegetarian cafes, yoga and exercise classes, or psychic development workshops. As a further aid in locating a particular group or practitioner, an alphabetical index of all the advertisers is also included., While the greatest amount of space is given to the resource directory, each issue of Common Ground also includes several
feature articles, generally grouped around a common theme. There are also regular columns including book reviews, music reviews, and letters to the editor. A column called "On the Path" features biographical sketches of various group leaders and practitioners., From its modest beginning, Common Ground had grown into a 144-page large-format quarterly. Over the years periodicals serving other urban areas in North America adopted not only Common Ground 's format but even its name. It is distributed free throughout the San Francisco Bay area from headquarters at 305 San Anselmo Ave., Ste. 313, San Anselmo, CA 94960. It has an Internet site at http://www.commongroundmag.com/., Common Ground. San Anselmo, Calif. n.d. Common Ground. http://www.commongroundmag.com/. March 15, 2000,

Common Ground (Vancouver) initially appeared in the early 1990s with a self-conscious Canadian focus. Like its model, it is an oversized periodical, approximately 30 pages per issue, largely supported by its many advertisers in the local New Age community., Common Ground is built around its "Resource Directory," a listing of organizations and events updated monthly. Directory listings are presented categorically under such headings as books and music; spiritual practices; health, healing and body work; time-out, travel, and recreation; and intuitive arts. Shorter notices of events are included in the monthly "Date-book." These listings, all paid advertisements, are supple-mented by a number of display ads that collectively highlight the events, publications, and programs of the broad spectrum of the esoteric and holistic healing community in Western Canada. These notices of the activities and resources available to readers provide the main appeal of Common Ground, which appears monthly and is distributed free thorough the metaphysical bookstores and health food stores in British Columbia. Each issue of Common Ground also includes one or two feature articles, shorter articles on news of interest, brief book reviews, and several columns. The content of the articles and columns has shown a particular interest in holistic healing and the natural environment., Common Ground (Vancouver) is published at 201-3091 W. Broadway, Vancouver, BC V6K 2G9, Canada, just down the street from the Banyen Tree, Western Canada's largest New Age bookstore., Common Ground (Vancouver). Vancouver, Canada, n.d.,
