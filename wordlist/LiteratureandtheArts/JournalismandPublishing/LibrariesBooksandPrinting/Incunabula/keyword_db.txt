[Copyright The Columbia University Press, incunabula (Ĭn´kyŏŏnăb´yŏŏlə), plural of incunabulum [Late Lat.,=cradle (books); i.e., books of the cradle days of printing], books printed in the 15th cent. The known incunabula represent about 40,000 editions. The books include products of more than 1,000 presses, including such famous printers as Gutenberg, Jenson, Caxton, and Aldus Manutius and give evidence as to the development of typography in its formative period. These books were generally large quarto size, bound in calf over boards of wood, decorated with red initials (rubricated) and ornamental borders, and carrying a colophon but no title page. Notable European collections of incunabula are in Paris, London (British Museum), Oxford (Bodleian Library), Vienna, Rome, Milan, Brussels, and The Hague. Notable American collections are in Washington, D.C. (Library of Congress), New York City (Morgan Library and others), Providence (John Carter Brown Library and Annmary Brown Memorial), San Marino, Calif. (Henry E. Huntington Library), and in the libraries of Harvard and Yale Univ. For an introduction to incunabula and a guide to further study, see Margaret B. Stillwell, Incunabula and Americana 1450–1800 (2d ed. 1961).,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, The term incunabula (or "cradle books") denotes books printed before 1500, including broadsheets, or other typographical products printed from letterpress composed of movable type. The first book known to be printed by Gutenberg in Germany dates from 1445. Jews were denied the opportunity of learning the art of *printing as long as it was exclusively practiced within Germany, where the strict rules of the guilds forbade the admission of apprentices who were not proved to be legitimately born sons of Christian citizens., In 1465 Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz, two immigrant printers from Germany, established themselves at Subiaco, near Rome, printing books in Latin. It can be assumed that they were the teachers, instructors, or foremen of an industrious group of Jewish printers (or typesetters) supposed to have been active in Rome or its vicinity c. 1470 (see printers' list, no. 1)., , It has been estimated that c. 50,000 incunabula editions were published, c. 35,000 of them still represented by copies fully or partially preserved. Included in this total are the 175 (207) editions printed with Hebrew letters ascertained by copies preserved in public collections (see below). It is in no way certain that there is a complete list of all books printed in Hebrew during the 15th century. Two books supposed to have been printed before 1492 (s-tc 249 and 250) have not been included in the list at the end of this entry because there is no proof for their existence. Another case is the 15th-century Venetian *Haggadah woodcuts (Soncino-Blaetter, 1 (1925), 78) because it is not sure whether these are pages from a book or parts of a cycle of illustrations. During the last two centuries the interest in, and the knowledge of, Hebrew incunabula has increased considerably. While de *Rossi listed 60 items in 1776 and 86 in 1795, J. Jacobs in 1906 (in je, 6 (1906), 778–9) enumerated 102, and A.M. Habermann in 1950 (in EIV, 2 (1950), 984–5) had 153 titles. H.M.Z. Meyer (in A. Freimann and M. Marx, Thesaurus… (19692), supplement to pt. 1) listed 185 incunabula of which ten were considered doubtful. The number of the "lost" incunabula has been estimated as one third of the number of "confirmed" editions. The scarcity of incunabula – and the high prices they command – though natural enough in view of the small editions printed and the lapse of time, is also due in a certain measure to the inroads of Church *censorship and book burnings in Italy, and in Spain to the Inquisition and expulsions., Incunabula have mostly appeared in folio format (106) against 40 in quarto and 29 in octavo or smaller formats. As to the number of leaves, it is impossible to account for those of the 70 incunabula which are only partially preserved. An analysis of the 105 complete editions reveals the following figures:, 2 folios and 2 quartos each containing 1–16 leaves;, 8 folios and 10 quartos and 3 smaller sizes each containing 17–96 leaves;, 28 folios and 14 quartos and 5 smaller sizes each containing 97–192 leaves;, 23 folios and 3 quartos each containing 193–400 leaves;, 6 folios and 1 smaller size each containing 401–626 leaves., Together 67 folios and 29 quartos and 9 smaller sizes = 105 incunabula., Owing to the scarcity of paper and the complicated manual work involved in the operation of the printing presses, editions were relatively small-sized. During the 1470s, many Latin books appeared in editions of 100 or 125 copies; Sweynheym and Pannartz produced only 275 to 300 copies of each of their twenty-eight publications. Hebrew printers, too, have occasionally reported on the size of their editions: 300 copies of the 1477 edition of the Book of Psalms (no. 40); 380 of Hoshen Mishpat in 1480 (no. 136); and 400 of David Kimhi's commentary on the Latter Prophets (no. 148). It seems possible that Abraham Conat limited his Tur Oraḥ Ḥayyim to 125 copies., The proto-printers were not interested in creating anything looking different from the style and form of the manuscript codices. Books from Conat's presses have often been taken for manuscripts with popular appeal. The early incunabula, therefore, have no title pages, open spaces are left for the illuminators and illustrators, and only at the end of the text, in the so-called *colophon, some information is given on the printer(s), their scholarly or technical staff, the place of work, and the date at which the printing was completed. Unfortunately, these colophons are often missing and very seldom contain all the information desired by the presentday bibliographer., , Hebrew incunabula were printed by the same methods and with the same utensils as those used by the non-Jewish presses. A letterpress was composed from types, the lead block supporting each of them being 27 mm. long and 6 mm. wide (according to the reproduction in Thes. A10, 2), the same measurements as of the Latin types of the same body. Types were arranged into lines by putting them into a composing stick, they were then transferred into the wooden galleys, and impressions of – mostly – two corresponding pages were made in the manually operated printing presses. Each copy had to be printed separately, the press each time to be opened, the letterpress to be blacked with printer's ink, and a new sheet of moistened paper to be inserted. When Conat claimed that the daily output of his printing shop was only 125 copies he may be taking also into account typesetting and correcting. The printers were keen to economize, to lease typographical material from other printers, or to buy it second hand. In order to make the fullest use of the labor invested in typesetting, the printer of the Bible in Brescia in 1493 (no. 10) broke some of the columns of the letter-press composed for this edition into two parts, thus producing every time two pages of a handy pocket edition published by him in the same year (no. 49)., The numbering of the leaves or pages, the inclusion of "signatures" (the special marks inserted at the bottom of the pages as a guide for the bookbinder's work of compiling the book from single sheets) are not to be found in the first decades of Hebrew printing, and make their appearance only at a later time. The first Hebrew text with vowels was printed in the Mahzor Roma, 1485 (no. 102), signatures were first used by Joshua Soncino (no. 58), and the earliest attempt of a Hebrew title page was made by Gershom Soncino in his edition of Tur Oraḥ Ḥayyim (no. 130). Eliezer Alantansi is the only Jew known to have used a printer's mark during the 15th century (nos. 128 and 134)., Joshua Soncino was also the first to introduce ornamented initials (see *Books: Book Illustrations). He fitted such letters into frames of similarly engraved woodcut borders, marking in this way the beginning of a book. Such headings appeared for the first time in his edition of the Talmud tractate Berakhot, 1483 (no. 58). Four years later (no. 173) he began to use a beautifully ornamented woodcut frame previously used by Francesco del Tuppo in his edition of the Fables by Aesop, published at Naples, Italy, on February 13, 1485. Joshua used this border several times for framing the first pages of his editions before he passed it on to other printing shops. Other Hebrew printers who used ornamented initial letters and borders were the Gunzenhausers of Naples. They printed with Soncino's woodcuts. The frame in Bahya b. Asher's Pentateuch commentary (no. 117) was printed a month earlier in Leonardo Aretino's L'Aquila finished on June 27, 1492 by Aiolfo de Cantone. It may be assumed that this woodcut and all the other ornaments used by the Gunzenhausers were the work of Moses b. Isaac, a Jewish woodcut artist, the brother-in-law of Azriel Gunzenhauser., , The initials and frames used by the two Eliezers at Hijar and Lisbon (see printers' list no. 15 and 17) are produced from metal-cuts executed by the silversmith Alfonso Fernandes de Cordoba, a printer in Valencia (see printers' list no. 15)., A Hebrew printer was able to acquire everything needed for his work by purchase, loan or exchange, the only exception being the Hebrew type which could not be obtained at the typefoundries or from other commercial sources. Every Hebrew printer therefore had to make his own set of matrices in order to case the typographical material required. The ductus to these types differs, of course, according to the style and taste of the scribes whose work was used as copy for the cutter of the punches (see *Printing; *Typography)., Hebrew incunabula were printed on excellent, locally made paper which stood the test of centuries and sometimes helps to locate books whose place of printing is not established by the colophon (no. 14). Copies of the same edition are known to have been printed on normal-size and on large-size paper, indicating that even then "deluxe editions" were produced. Thirty-six Hebrew incunabula survived in copies printed on parchment, thirty of them originating from Italian presses and six from Spain or Portugal. All these incunabula have also been published on ordinary paper., , The study of incunabula has been hampered by the fact that more than one third of the editions known contain no information as to when, where, or by whom they were printed. Furthermore no colophons are preserved for a large number of books which survived in fragments only, having been saved from oblivion by the 16th-century custom of using waste paper as a substitute for wooden boards in book covers. The same applies to Hebrew incunabula, and this is the reason for the many lacunae in the list of Hebrew printers. The first to investigate incunabula systematically was the Italian Hebraist and collector G.B. de'Rossi. His careful description of 86 incunabula, most of them in his possession, is unsurpassed in spite of many corrections needed in detail. Moritz *Steinschneider in his Catalogus Librorum Hebraeorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana (1852–1860) enumerated the incunabula described by de'Rossi more briefly and added 17 further incunabula. Important are his notes on the personalities of the printers, appearing as the third part of the catalog. In his article on Jewish typography in Ersch-Gruber encyclopedia (vol. 28, 1851, repr. 1938) he enumerates 89 numbers and estimates that there exist rather less than 100. Following the publication of many learned papers and special catalogs, Aron Freimann in his paper (Ueber Hebraeische Inkunabeln, 1902) arrived at a total of 101 incunabula which he arranged according to printing places and presses. Freimann-Marx's Thesaurus Typographiae Hebraicae Saeculi xv (1932) contains 330 large plates with facsimile reproductions of the typographically most important parts of 126 books, 123 of them incunabula. More recently, Y. Vinograd (1995) has collected 207 Hebrew incunabula., The importance of Hebrew incunabula for Jewish scholarship lies in their use for textual criticism, these early editions having been printed from reliable manuscripts and edited and proofread by scholars. This is true, in particular, for the many Bible editions and the uncensored texts of the Talmud and Maimonides' Code., Public collections of importance are listed below, the numbers attached indicating the number of Hebrew incunabula in their possession, duplicates not being counted:, Cambridge, University Library (29);, Cincinnati, Hebrew Union College (65);, Copenhagen, Det Kongelige Bibliotek (50, mostly from the Lazarus Goldschmidt Collection);, Frankfurt on the Main, Stadtund Universitaetsbibliothek (49, formerly 59);, Jerusalem, Jewish National and University Library (65, mostly from the S. Schocken Collection);, London, British Museum;, New York, Jewish Theological Seminary (127);, Oxford, Bodleian Library;, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale (34);, Parma, Bibliotheca Palatina (Collection de Rossi);, St. Petersburg, Bibliotheca Friedlandiana (34);, Turin, Biblioteca Nazionale (25);, Vienna, Kultusgemeinde (28)., Twenty-four (or twenty-six; see no. 9) Hebrew printing shops are known to have been working during the 15th century, 12 (14) of them in Italy, nine in the Iberian Peninsula, one in Paris, one in Leiden, and one in Constantinople. For 18 of these presses their places of printing are mentioned in the colophons of the books produced by them. While the location of three more printing houses may be assumed with a certain degree of probability, it is impossible to place four of the printers on the map. On the other hand, the books printed for the "patrons" at *Faro do not indicate the name of their printers. There are, finally, five more or less completely preserved books (nos. 86, 88, 89, 111, and 149 in the list) which contain no colophon or any other means of identification of the printer, the place of printing, or the date., The following is a complete list of printers based on the documentary evidence of the colophons in books preserved:, 1. obadiah (b. moses?), manasseh, and benjamin, of Rome (colophon of no. 163). A comparison of the measurements of their book pages with the size of other contemporary productions has led to the assumption that they had learned the trade from Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz, two German master printers working from 1465 at Subbiaco, a monastery in the neighborhood of Rome, and in Rome itself. It has been assumed, therefore, that Rome was the place of Hebrew printing sometime between 1469 and 1472. Identity of the typographical material used led to the conclusion that the books recorded as nos. 16, 107, 150, 153, 163, 167, and 170 also originate from this printing shop. Obadiah may be identical with his namesake under 2 (below)., 2. solomon b. judah and obadiah b. moses (colophon of no. 156). The place of printing and the dating are conjectures based on typographical comparison. Obadiah may be identical with the leader of the group of printers under 1 (above)., 3. *abraham b. garton b. isaac. He completed the printing of no. 171 on February 18, 1475, at Reggio di Calabria, as stated in the colophon. This is the first Hebrew book to appear with a full statement of all the three important bibliographical facts., 4. meshullam cusi and his sons, printers at *Piove di Sacco; their first-known work (no. 124) was published on July 3, 1475. The sons are supposed to have printed no. 98, using the typographical material belonging to their father's estate., , 5. abraham b. solomon *conat of Mantua, talmudist and physician. June 1476 and June 1477 are two dates recorded in the colophons of books originating from his press; his name is mentioned in no. 127, 143, 141, and 151, the place of printing in no. 127, and the dates in nos. 127 and 132. Printers employed by him were Abraham Jedidiah ha-Ezrahi of Cologne and Jacob Levi of Tarascon, as well as his wife Estellina. The printing of no. 132 began at his presses but after the first 31 leaves *Abraham b. Ḥayyim dei Tintori of Ferrara took over and printed the remaining 60 leaves., 6. abraham b. hayyim dei tintori. He completed no. 120 on May 17, 1477, and the remainder of no. 132 on June 25, 1477, working at this time at *Ferrara. Later on, printing at *Bologna for Joseph b. Abraham Caravita, he completed no. 13 on January 26, 1482. No. 54 has been ascribed to him. Nathan of Salo worked as editor of no. 152, and Joseph Ḥayyim b. Aaron Strasbourg Ẓarefati was corrector of no. 13. In 1488, Abraham himself served as corrector for Joshua Soncino., 7. joseph, his son Ḥayyim mordecai, and hezekiah montero, of Ventura. Joseph bears the title "Meister," probably because he was the apprentice of a German master printer. It has been suggested that his son was called Ḥayyim Mordecai and that the name Neriah is only based on a typographical error (ונריה instead of ובריה; Aram., "and his son"). No. 40 was finished in his printing shop on August 24, 1477, but no place of printing is mentioned in the colophons; some bibliographers assume that the work was done at Bologna. Nos. 41 and 42 are ascribed to this office., 8. isaac b. aaron d'este and moses b. eliezer rafael. Only one book is known to have been printed by this firm (no. 14). The colophon of their work gives no indication of the place or date of printing, but mentions the names of six co-workers employed., , 9 (a). joshua solomon b. israel nathan soncino, the founder of this leading family of printers which for three generations produced books remarkable for their number, contents, and typographical perfection. The family originated from Speyer on the Rhine, and settled in the first half of the 15thcentury at Soncino, a small town in Lombardy. Joshua's name appears in the colophons of nos. 6, 55, 58, 65, 90, and 121. The place name is mentioned in nos. 6, 33, 58, 65, 71, 87, 101, and 139, while Naples as place of printing is reported in nos. 45, 55, 90, and 146. The earliest date recorded for Soncino is December 19, 1483 (no. 58), and the latest July 23, 1489 (no. 84); the list of books printed at Naples extends from May 25, 1490 (no. 90) to May 8, 1492 (no. 55). Editors of books printed by Joshua were: Solomon b. Perez Bonfroi Zarefati (no. 121) and Samuel b. Meir Latif (no. 71), both of them later employed by *Gunzenhauser, and David b. Eleazar ha-Levi (nos. 82 and 84), who had previously worked as corrector (no. 76); other correctors were Gabriel b. Aaron Strasbourg (nos. 58 and 65), the brother of Joseph Ḥayyim b. Aaron (no. 13), Abraham b. Ḥayyim dei Tintori (no. 6), and Mordecai b. Reuben Ẓarefati (nos. 82 and 84)., 9 (b). joshua solomon soncino and joseph ibn peso. They completed on May 8, 1492, at Naples, the printing of no. 55. This is the most voluminous book ever printed by Joshua (see 9, above) and therefore he may have been obliged to execute this work in partnership, something he never did before or afterwards., 9 (c). benei soncino, the sons of Soncino. This imprint appears in nos. 108 (Soncino, October 31–December 29, 1485), 102 (Soncino and Casalmaggiore, September 10, 1485–August 21, 1486), and 63 (Naples, 1491). It is unknown if this was a partnership – and who were the partners – or if this is the name of an enterprise belonging to Joshua, as it is sometimes assumed., 10. joseph b. jacob gunzenhauser (ashkenazi) and his son azriel. Joseph's name is mentioned in nos. 43, 118, 144 and 165, first on March 28, 1487, and for the last time on January 23, 1490. Father and son are mentioned together in no. 122, and the son alone in nos. 114 and 117 (November 9, 1491, and July 3, 1492). They printed at Naples, as stated in the colophons of nos. 38, 43, 114, 117, 122, 144, 146, and 165. It is most probable that the first book printed by Joshua Soncino at Naples was produced by order of Joseph, because the name Ben Porat mentioned in the colophon as the initiator of this work is a synonym for Joseph (Gen. 49:22). The names recorded as Gunzenhauser's collaborators or employees are: Jacob Baruch b. Judah Landau, author of no. 149, who also edited no. 43, the first book to be printed by Gunzenhauser; his son Abraham, who corrected no. 114; Ḥayyim b. Isaac ha-Levi Ashkenazi (no. 51); Samuel b. Samuel of Rome (no. 38); Moses b. Shem Tov b. ḥabib of Lisbon (no. 122); Samuel b. Meir Latif (no. 147), mentioned above as a member of Soncino's staff; Asher b. Perez Minẓ (= Min Ẓarefat), typesetter of no. 114; Samuel b. Hezekiah ha-Levi (no. 114); the brothers Solomon and Yom Tov b. Perez Ẓarefati (nos. 117, and 144), who presumably were the brothers of the Asher b. Perez, mentioned before. The Gunzenhausers remained in good relations with the Soncinos, as shown by the use of Soncino's woodcut in Gunzenhauser's book (cf. nos. 117 and 164)., 11. gershom (also called Menzlein) b. moses soncino, nephew of Joshua Soncino. During the 15th century he printed at Soncino (no. 158), Brescia (nos. 10, 24, 49, 123), Barco (no. 110), and at another unidentified place in Italy. This unsteady life was a result of chicanes which prevented a prolonged stay. Seventeen of the books printed by him are known to be incunabula, and 11 of them bear his name. Incunabula bearing his imprint are dated between December 19, 1488, and November 16, 1497. The only name of a co-worker given by one of his colophons is Eliezer b. Samuel who edited no. 158., 12. solomon b. moses soncino, a brother of Gershom. According to the evidence of the colophons preserved, he has only one book (no. 125) to his credit. No dates or places of work are reported. It could be assumed that he was one of the "Sons of Soncino" (see 9 (c) above)., 13. juan de lucena, a Marrano printer working at Montalban, Spain. The names of his co-workers are recorded in no. 103, but there is no proof that the book described under this number was really a product of his printing shop., , 14. solomon b. moses ibn alkabeẒ, a printer at Guadalajara, Spain. His name and place of residence are reported in nos. 136 and 148, the latter being finished during the last week of December 1480. Another book attributed to his press (no. 172) was published on September 5, 1476, while no. 148 was printed in 1482. Other books attributed to his presses, on the evidence of the typographical material used, are nos. 59, 62–64, 67, 70, 74, 80, 81, 112, 133, and 135., 15. eliezer b. abraham ibn alantansi, owner of a printing shop and physician at Hijar, Spain. The name of the printer and the town are mentioned in the colophon of no. 134. Abraham b. Isaac b. David corrected no. 17, which was most probably printed by Eliezer for Solomon b. Maimon Zalmati. The books produced by Eliezer's presses are outstanding for their technical perfection and beautiful ornamentation. The frame printed in no. 16 has been praised by the historians of book illustration as the most remarkable example of this period. Most delicately incised animals, fruits, flowers, and ornamental lines enliven the black background, and the same balance between black and white is sustained in the composition of the initials. These metal engravings are the work of Alfonso Fernandez de Cordoba, a silversmith, type cutter, and printer in Valencia. Alfonso used the same frame, together with a suitable set of Latin initials, in the Manuale Caesar Augustanum, supposed to have been printed by him at Hijar in about 1487. But the relation between this book and Eliezer's publication is obscured by the fact that the Hebrew printing took place before and after the Latin printing, and that the frame shows proofs of wear and tear not to be found in the Hebrew books. This frame, together with the initial letters and other printing types used by Eliezer, can later be traced to the books originating from the presses of Eliezer Toledano (no. 19) in Lisbon., 16. printing shop at faro, a town in the Portuguese province of Algarve. The identity of the printer(s) working at this town for Don Samuel Gacon (no. 15, finished on June 30, 1487) and for Don Samuel Porteira (no. 73, published in December 1494 or 1496) is unknown. Nos. 60 and 79 are attributed to one or the other of these two patrons (or publishers)., 17. eliezer toledano, mentioned as printer in nos. 19, 37, 115, and 166; the same colophons show Lisbon as his place of work. The earliest date in his colophons is July 18, 1488, while 1492 appears in no. 37. Eliezer, like his namesake in Hijar, was a physician and used in his books the frame, initial letters and printing types to be found in the works of the Hijar presses. It was therefore obvious to assume the identity of these two printers, especially as the activities at Hijar ended at approximately the time the work at Lisbon began. The distance between Hijar and Lisbon is approximately 400 miles, with Toledo as the midway station; that the new arrival was called by a name different from the one he bore at his place of departure is not surprising; it can be paralleled by many examples from European Jewry during the Middle Ages down to the 18th century. But no definite assertions can be made until further facts come to light., 18. shem tov ibn Ḥala and his son judah. They printed one book (no. 116), finished on October 21, 1491, at some unidentified place in Spain or Portugal., 19. moses ibn shealtiel. The one book produced by him in Spain or Portugal (no. 159) contains no reference to place or date of printing., 20. samuel b. musa, together with immanuel, working as printers at Zamora, Spain; their names and place of work appear in the colophon of no. 174., 21. samuel d'ortas and his three sons, one of them named abraham, printers at Leiria, Portugal. Their names are found in nos. 53 and 34, their place of work in no. 34 only. Their colophons are dated July 25, 1492, January 1494, and June 2, 1495., 22. david and his son samuel ibn naḥmias, printers at Constantinople. Their edition of the Arba'ah Turim is dated December 13, 1493, as clearly stated in the colophon of no. 126. The correctness of the date has been doubted because other works were printed at this press at a much later period only., Incunabula (index to places of publication), Incunabula (index to dates of publication), † Numbers given in italics indicate either a span of possible publication dates or one uncertain date., List of Incunabula (alphabetical from no. 106), 1. the holy bible – Complete Edition.
