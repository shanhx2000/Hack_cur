, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, A technical term of paleography, used to designate a MS of leather or parchment that was used more than once. Since such materials were scarce and expensive, the writing was often erased from an old codex by washing and/or scraping, so that the surface could be used again. The term refers only to leather or parchment MSS, since papyrus and paper would not permit such rough treatment. If the MS was erased twice, it was called a double palimpsest. The original writing was seldom completely destroyed and can frequently be read, at least in part. As a result, some palimpsests have great value for the scholar. Chemical agents such as ammonium hydrosulfide once proved useful in making the text readable, but today ultraviolet lamps and especially infrared photography aid in deciphering a text. The most famous palimpsests of the Bible are the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), Codex Nitriensis (R), and Codex Syrus-Sinaiticus., [t. h. weber],
