[Copyright The Columbia University Press, bibliography: The listing of books is of ancient origin. Lists of clay tablets have been found at Nineveh and elsewhere; the library at Alexandria had subject lists of its books. Modern bibliography began with the invention of printing and at first consisted of
"trade"
bibliographies, i.e., lists of the publications of important publishing houses, comparable to those in the present-day Publisher's Trade List Annual, British Books in Print, and Books in Print. There have been efforts at universal bibilography: in 1545 at Zürich, Konrad von Gesner published his Bibliotheca universalis; in 1895 the International Institute of Bibliography was established at Brussels. There are national bibliographies, such as the Library of Congress Catalog and the British Museum Catalogue; subject bibliographies, such as Sabin's Dictionary of Books Relating to America; and lists of the works of individual authors. Bibliographies of rare and old books include Book Prices Current.The Cumulative Book Index is a monthly bibliography of books in the English language that cumulates annually. The Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature is useful for British publications, and the Bibliographic Guide to the Study of the Literature of the U.S.A., by C. L. Gohdes, for American works. The Bibliographical Index, which is cumulative, and World Bibliography of Bibliographies are useful compilations. The term bibliography is also used to describe books as physical objects and their production history, and has been expanded to include nonprint media such as microfilm.

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, As in general bibliography, the development of Hebrew bibliography is characterized by the transition from brief listings to more detailed catalogues. The listing of the books of the Bible which appears in the Talmud (bb 14b, 15a) had as its purpose the fixing of an authoritative order for the biblical books as a guide for the copyists. Lists of books for broader purposes, among them those of the Cairo Genizah, have come down from the 11th century. Sometimes these listings contain only the name of the book; in other cases, the author's name is also included. In some of the later booklists, short annotations also appear. Bibliographical lists within the biographical listings are found in genealogical works of the 16th century, as in Sefer Yuḥasin by Abraham *Zacuto and in Shalshelet ha-Kabbalah by Gedaliah *Ibn Yaḥya. In the early part of the 17th century several important ventures in the field of bibliography were undertaken. Johannes *Buxtorf the elder published De abbreviaturis hebraicis, liber novus et copiosus (Basle, 1613) in which he included a section on rabbinic literature entitled Bibliotheca rabbinica ordine alphabetico disposita. This listing of 324 works, arranged in alphabetical order by titles, is the first bibliographic catalogue of rabbinic literature. *Manasseh Ben Israel, in his listing of sources used by him in the first part of his Conciliador (Frankfurt, 1632), distinguished six categories of Hebrew literature: Talmud and Midrash; commentaries on these; commentaries on the Bible; Kabbalah; posekim and responsa; sermons, grammar, chronology, and legal literature. The first, however, to compile a true bibliography of Hebrew literature was Giulio *Bartolocci in his Bibliotheca Magna Rabbinica (4 vols., Rome, 1675–93; repr. 1969). The Christian scholar Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati added a fifth volume, Bibliotheca Latina Hebraica (Rome, 1694). Bartolocci's work is arranged in alphabetical order of authors, supplemented by a list of subjects in Latin and an abridged listing in Hebrew. Leone *Modena assisted the bishop of Lodève, J. Plantavit de la Pause; in his Bibliotheca Rabbinica (appended to his Florilegium Biblicum, 1645) by supplying him with a list of 500 names of rabbis, which he used for his alphabetic dictionary of 780 Hebrew books. The first Jewish bibliographer was Shabbetai *Bass whose Siftei Yeshenim (Amsterdam, 1680) contains a bibliography arranged by title, followed by the name of the author, the date and place of publication, the format, and some indication of content. The approximate number of listings in this bibliography is 2,200, including manuscripts. The third important pioneer bibliographer was another Christian, Johann Christoph *Wolf. He utilized the two previous bibliographies in compiling his own four-volume work, Bibliotheca Hebraea (Hamburg, 1715–33; repr. 1969). He corrected some of the material found in the earlier works, using the library of David b. Abraham *Oppenheim. The genealogical reference work of David *ConforteKore ha-Dorot (1746, 18462) contains much valuable bibliographic material. It should be noted, also, that Jehiel *Heilperin included in his Seder ha-Dorot (Karlsruhe, 1769) the names of the books which are referred to in Bass' bibliography, though generally he omitted the place and year of publication, even when these were included in the Siftei Yeshenim. Especially valuable from a bibliographical standpoint is the H.J.D. *Azulai's Shem ha-Gedolim (1774–86, 1853, 1876), which contains an alphabetical listing of Hebrew books and manuscripts. Azulai noted every unusual Hebrew book or manuscript, even those in non-Jewish collections, which came to his notice in the course of his extensive travels without, however, always giving the date and place of publication. The major work of the Christian scholar G.B. *de' Rossi, Annales Hebraeo-Typographici Seculi xv (Parma, 1795), dealing with Hebrew incunabula, together with his Annales Hebraeo-Typographici ab anno 1501 ad 1540 (Parma, 1799), and the Dizionario storico degli autori Ebrei e delle loro opere (2 vols., Parma, 1802), as well as assorted lists of Hebrew publications from various Italian cities, serve as a transition to modern bibliography., With the development of Jewish studies, Hebrew bibliography became a scientific discipline in its own right. L. *Zunz's Zur Geschichte und Literatur (1845) contains a complete section on bibliography (pp. 214–303), including material on the dates found in books; on printers and typography in Mantua from 1476 to 1662; and on Hebrew printing in Prague from 1513 to 1657. This work laid the foundation for modern Hebrew bibliography. In 1849 Julius *Fuerst published the first part of his Bibliotheca Judaica (3 vols., 1849–63). The book is neither all-inclusive nor completely accurate, but it is important in view of its comprehensiveness. It is arranged according to author, commentator, editor, and publisher, with an alphabetical index to the Hebrew works appended to the end of the third volume. The format of each book is noted, and sometimes the number of pages as well. The preceding bibliographies are overshadowed by the works of Moritz *Steinschneider, in particular by his Catalogus Librorum Hebraeorum in Bibliotheca Bodleiana (1852–60) and Die hebraeischen Uebersetzungen des Mittelalters (1893). These works set the definitive standard for modern Jewish bibliography. Another important bibliography is Isaac *Benjacob's Oẓar ha-Sefarim, (1877–80), listing Jewish books and manuscripts until 1863, and published by the author's son Jacob, together with notes by Steinschneider. By the late 19th century Jewish bibliography, comprising Jewish literature in all languages, had undergone considerable development and today compares favorably with general bibliography. Aaron *Walden, who followed Azulai with the Shem ha-Gedolim he-Ḥadash (1864) included a section entitled, "A Catalogue of Books," which includes ḥasidic works absent from earlier listings. However, this listing was not done scientifically. William *Zeitlin, in his Kiryat Sefer, Bibliotheca Hebraica post-Mendelssohniana (1891–95), listed the works of the Haskalah movement to that date (more than 3,500 volumes). Ḥayyim David Lippe published a catalogue called Asaf ha-Mazkir (1881–89), "a complete listing of all the books, treatises, and Hebrew periodicals which appeared during the period 1880–1887." He also issued a follow-up catalogue, Asaf ha-Mazkir he-Ḥadash… (1899), "listing all the books, treatises, and periodicals which appeared during the period 1882–1898." From 1928 to 1931 H.D. *Friedberg published his Beit Eked Sefarim, a bibliographical lexicon covering the general field of Hebrew literature, with particular attention to books written in Hebrew and Yiddish; but also including works written in Italian, Latin, Greek, Spanish, Arabic, Persian, and Samaritan, and printed in Hebrew characters from 1475–1900, with their general content, author, date, place of publication, and number of pages. An expanded edition of this work appeared in 1951–54. Though not truly scientific in its approach, it is still very useful. The many, important studies of Abraham Yaari include Meḥkerei Sefer (1958), containing among its studies in Hebrew booklore a section on the catalogue of Israel. M. *Kasher and Dov Mandelbaum compiled a bibliography of works covering the years 500–1500 called Sarei ha-Elef (1959). Important monographs and articles in the field of Hebrew bibliography have been written by S. *Wiener, I. *Sonne, S. *Seeligmann, D. *Chwolson, A. *Jellinek, A.M. *Habermann, C. *Lieberman, A. *Marx, M. *Roest, G. *Kressel, J. *Zedner, I. *Rivkind, S. Shunami, N. Ben-Menahem, and others. The indispensable handbook today is S. Shunami's Bibliography of Jewish Bibliographies (1936, 19652; repr. 1969, with supplement) which also includes sections on Jewish and Modern Hebrew literature (nos. 1146–1240; 4875–85) as well as on Judeo-German and Yiddish (nos. 1241–1357; 4586–95). In 1960 the Hebrew University, in cooperation with Mosad Bialik and the Ministry of Education and Culture, initiated the Institute for Hebrew Bibliography under the direction of N. Ben-Menahem. Its aim is to compile a definitive bibliographical listing of every Hebrew book which has been published up to 1960 (specimen brochure, 1964)., The first scholar to publish a special periodical devoted to Hebrew and Jewish bibliography was Steinschneider: Ha-Mazkir, Hebraeische Bibliographie, Blaetter fuer neuere und aeltere Literatur des Judenthums (hb, 1858–65, 1869–82). Nehemiah *Bruell continued Steinschneider's project in the bimonthly Centralanzeiger fuer juedische Literatur (1890) but succeeded in publishing it only during one year (6 issues). At the same time M. *Kayserling published his bibliographical dictionary of Spanish and Portuguese works on Judaism and Jews (the Biblioteca española-portugueza judaica, 1890). A few years later the Zeitschrift fuer Hebraeische Bibliographie (zhb; 1896–1921) appeared. The editor of volumes 1–3 was H. Brody; volumes 4–9 were edited jointly by Brody and A. Freimann; and the remaining volumes appeared under the editorship of Freimann alone. The two great authorities on the bibliography of Anglo-Jewish history are C. Roth's Magna Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica (1937), and R.P. *Lehmann's Nova Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica (1961), the latter dealing with the years 1937–60. The most important contemporary bibliographical journal is Kirjat Sepher (ks), a quarterly published since 1924 under the auspices of the Jewish National and University Library. Editors during the first two years were S.H. Bergmann and H. Pick, and after that I.B. Joel. Since 1953 a new bibliographical magazine, Studies in Bibliography and Booklore (sbb), has been published by the Hebrew Union College Library, Cincinnati. The Jewish Book Annual (jba; founded in 1942) published in New York also contains useful bibliographical material. Of Jewish bibliographic periodicals whose life-span was limited, the following deserve mention: En Hakore, edited by D.A. Friedman and Z. *Woyslawski, three issues (Berlin, 1923); Soncino-Blaetter, Beitraege zur Kunde des juedischen Buches, edited by H. *Meyer (3 vols., Berlin, 1925–30); and Journal of Jewish Bibliography, a quarterly edited by Joshua *Bloch (New York, 1938–43)., The first bookdealers' catalogue of secondhand Hebrew books was published in Amsterdam around 1640 by Manasseh Ben Israel, but no copy is now extant (cf. Roth in Aresheth, 2, 413–4). In 1652 his son Samuel published Catalogo de los Libros que Semuel ben Israel Soeiro vende, estampados todos nasua Typographia, adjuntos os preços, para que cada qual saibo o que valem. In this catalogue 65 books are noted together with their prices in Dutch currency. The earliest known auction sale catalogues are those of the libraries of two Amsterdam rabbis, Moses Raphael *d'Aguilar (1680) and Isaac *Aboab da Fonseca (1693). The only earlier commercial listings of Hebrew books are in manuscript form, such as some found in the Genizah, or the catalogue of Hebrew books printed in Venice prior to 1542, which came into the possession of Konrad Gesner and appeared in his Pandectarum sive partitionum universalium libri xxi (20 vols., Zurich 1548–49; cf. zhb, 10 (1906), 38–42). A catalogue of books compiled for business purposes was printed as an appendix to the collection of responsa by Joseph ibn Lev (vol. 4, Fuerth, 1692). Another commercial book listing, called Appiryon Shelomo, was published in 1730 by Solomon Proops, printer and bookdealer of Amsterdam. The advance in the field of Hebrew bibliography resulted in the publication of improved commercial catalogues (see *Booktrade). A number of these newer catalogues are of definite scientific value such as those of M. *Roest, R.N.N. Rabinowitz, L. Schwager and D. Fraenkel, J. Kauffmann, N.W. Bamberger and Wahrmann, Rosenthal (Munich, Oxford), and others. In addition, the detailed catalogues of such libraries as those of Oxford, Amsterdam, Leiden, Leningrad, Frankfurt, the British Museum, and the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, have proved extremely useful., [Abraham Meir Habermann], In 1975 Shunami published a supplement to the second edition of his Bibliography of Jewish Bibliographies (1965). The 500-page supplement contains information on over 2,000 bibliographies published between 1965 and 1975. In his introduction Shunami notes that this number compares with that for the first hundred years of the Wissenchaft des Judentums. He comments on the rapid growth of bibliographies relating to the Holocaust and to the State of Israel. On the other hand, the small number of entries related to Hebrew printing is a reflection of the decline of study of this subject with little extra interest having been aroused by the 500th anniversary of Hebrew printing. There is also a decrease in entries relating to private collections, reflecting a decline in major Jewish book collectors. Shunami also decries the shortage of Jewish bibliographers., S.

Roth, in: Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams (1927), 384–93; Shunami, Bibl, xiv–xv (Eng.), 7ff.; Urbach, in: ks, 15 (1938/39), 237–9; Assaf, ibid., 18 (1941/42), 272–81; Yaari, ibid., 21 (1944/45), 192–203; Zulay, ibid., 25 (1948/49), 203–5; Sonne, in: sbb, 1 (1953–54), 55–76; Aloni, in: Sefer Assaf (1953), 33–39; idem, in: Aresheth, 1 (1958), 44–60.,

Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
, 
Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style. Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
, 
Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates. Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Bibliography is the study of books as conceptual content and as physical objects. The books in question, once limited to hardbound objects available in bookstores, are today generally defined more broadly. The term "book" is now generally applied to all texts (be they published or in manuscript) that are meant to be permanent, including periodicals, maps, music, pictures, and ephemera, as well as materials preserved in the audiovisual and electronic media. The conceptual and physical aspects of these objects involve the two specialties of reference bibliography and analytical bibliography., Lists, inventories, footnotes, and prose essays are all ways in which readers and books can be brought together. To make these tools more useful to the reader, standard citations have been formulated for each situation. These citations emphasize content, even though the physical embodiment is inseparable., A bibliographical citation typically consists of an entry that names, In some cases, an annotation or abstract, describing the content in a free-form prose statement, is appended to the above elements in a bibliography citation., , Systematic bibliography is the study of the compiling of lists; enumerative bibliography is the study of the use of those lists. The lists themselves, generally referred to as bibliographies, are often qualified by adjectives that designate a topic, genre, or approach. Examples of this include subject or national bibliographies (e.g., French bibliographies), author bibliographies (e.g., Milton bibliographies), and critical bibliographies. Among the offspring of bibliographies are discographies, for sound recordings in whatever physical form, and filmographies, for motion pictures in whatever physical form. Archival finding aids and calendars, museum inventories, and many merchandise displays are often closely modeled on bibliographical lists. Although bibliographies are usually thought of as things to be consulted, people do read them as well. For example, browsers who are in search of perspectives on a topic would read through complete bibliographies, as would browsers who are interested in surveying a topic's literature in its entirety., Lists may be organized either in linear sequence on paper or randomly in computers. With printed lists, additional access often needs to be provided through the inclusion of indexes, classified lists, and tables of contents. With online lists, access depends on the vocabulary of searchable terms. Printed lists have the advantage of a structure that is visible to the reader. Online lists, however, may provide more current information. Each type depends on establishment of its credibility. Inevitably, bibliographies reflect their compilers'
conceptions of the unity, totality, and structure of the topic they cover; along the way, the compilers define the topic itself and aspire to canonize their literature. Bibliographies at once both describe and prescribe—their statements inevitably promote the texts in the process of referring to them. At the same time, the precise uses of bibliographies are inevitably determined by their readers., The difference between a catalog and a bibliography is still widely seen as one of function. While catalogs identify specific copies (e.g., of a book held by a library), bibliographies refer to writings in general (e.g., all books published on a topic). This distinction is now becoming obsolete, thanks to union catalogs that bring together writings or other media from many different library collections. These new types of catalogs can then work as bibliographies., , Bibliographic control (a concept that underlies the concern of the librarian for universal bibliographic control), along with its counterpart, bibliographical organization, involves strategies for making the entire world of books better available to readers. In the study of citation analysis, biblio-metrics employs statistics to evaluate bibliographical references and measure the patterns involved in the use of texts. As it offers gateways to the written literature of society, reference bibliography is obviously crucial to the communities of readers and to the use of books., Books, in addition to being studied for their content, can be studied as physical objects, in terms of both the materials used in them (paper, type, ink) and the activities involved in producing them (type design and composition, illustration, house practices of layout and presswork, printing processes, as well as binding and preservation). Among its interrelated specialties, textual bibliography (sometimes considered to be the same as textual criticism) is the study of the relationship between the content of the text and the physical form of the text as it is envisioned by those who create its conceptual and physical artifacts. The physical presentation of a book—its typeface, paper quality, and overall design, for example— subtly affects the way the message is read. In overt ways, the text itself thus often comes to be distorted through misreadings, editorial changes, or printing errors. Descriptive bibliography then formulates in scrupulous detail the statements that identify the physical book. This type of bibliography allows the user to compare a particular copy of a book with other copies of the same title in order to spot the differences and to determine what the ideal copy was meant to look like., The study of physical evidence ranges from the work of historians who confirm what exactly the text consisted of to the work of forensic specialists who uncover evidence of either authenticity or of tampering. Increasingly, this latter activity involves the scientific laboratory. The graphic arts, concerned with the visual presentation of words and/or pictures, are generally not seen as a branch of bibliography, although they are nonetheless essential to bibliography. Emphasizing printing as it does, physical bibliography has counterparts in the disciplines of paleography, which is concerned with manuscripts (those from the eras before printing in particular), and epigraphy, which is concerned with inscriptions and other writings on hard surfaces., The study of physical bibliography has long been the specialty not only of printing historians but also of bibliophiles and antiquarian book dealers, whose concerns for authenticity are closely related to the use of books as historical evidence. The work of these individuals is of basic importance in the study of the historical role of communication in society, and the interrelationships between its written, electronic, and oral forms. Historical bibliography, since it recognizes names, places, titles, and events, involves the study of the tastes and cultural dynamics of physical books to uncover the relationships between books and history. The term "book history" is also coming to be used for this field of study; a fascination with French annales historians has also inspired the term " histoire du livre." Recorded knowledge, in its iconic and symbolic forms, is abundantly in evidence today, thanks in large part to physical bibliography., See also:Cataloging and Knowledge Organization; Library Automation; Printing, History and Methods of., Krummel, Donald W.
