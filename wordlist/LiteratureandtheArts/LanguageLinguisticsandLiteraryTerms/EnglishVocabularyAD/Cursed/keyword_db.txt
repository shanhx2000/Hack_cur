Los Angelenos Ellie (Ricci) and her geeky brother Jimmy (Eisenberg) encounter a nasty beastie after a car accident. They get bitten and start developing werewolf-like tendencies. Ellie doesn't want to accept the truth as her girlfriends are becoming beastie fodder. Rick Baker did better effects back in 1981 with “An American Werewolf in London.” Film lives up to its title as it was rewritten, recast, reshot, and recut before it finally making it into the multiplex. 97m/C VHS, DVD .
