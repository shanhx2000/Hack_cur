, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Cowardice is a vice opposed to fortitude or courage by way of defect. Fortitude, one of the moral vir tues, moderates the passions or emotions of fear and daring, i.e., those emotions concerned with an evil, difficult but possible to overcome. Some theologians argue that there are four vices opposed to fortitude: cowardice (ignavia, vecordia ), which, taken most strictly, implies a lack of daring; foolhardiness, or audacity, which is an excess of daring; timidity, which is an excess of fear; and fearlessness, which is the absence of reasonable fear. Others, following St. thomas aquinas, argue that it is natural for man to have daring with regard to an object harmful to him, unless he is restrained by fear. In other words, a man does not lack daring except through excessive fear. Hence, timidity, or excessive fear, and cowardice, or lack of daring, are not distinct vices, but are two names or aspects of the same vice opposed to fortitude. Even those who hold that they are distinct vices would admit that the terms are often used interchangeably., The fear involved in timidity or cowardice is not simply the emotion of fear, for the emotions as such are morally indifferent. Rather it is an inordinate fear. In every sinful act some element of fear is present: the miser fears the loss of money, the slothful man fears the effort required for spiritual progress, the envious man fears the good of his neighbor. Timidity or cowardice is concerned with the arduous good, but it shrinks from the effort. Just as fortitude is properly concerned with great dangers, especially the danger of death, so cowardice or timidity, properly speaking, is an excess of fear and a lack of daring with regard to these dangers. Cowardice is sometimes used, however, in a wider sense for excessive fears about lesser matters. To conquer cowardice does not mean the total exclusion of fear, but rather the control of fear so that it does not impede an individual from doing his duty., Timidity or cowardice as such is venially sinful, but it becomes mortal, or is the cause of mortal sin, if it leads one to transgress the law of God in some serious way., Since the opportunities for exercising fortitude in the strict sense are limited, one should accustom himself to acting courageously in small matters and thus prepare himself for greater tests in which he might otherwise be overcome by cowardice. Meditation on the greatness of divine gifts, on the Passion of Christ, and on the courageous action of Our Lady and the martyrs is a strong incentive to overcome temptations to cowardice., Bibliography: thomas aquinas, Summa Theologiae, 2a2ae, 125, 127. f. de vitoria, Comentarios a la Secunda secundae de Santo Tomás, ed. v. beltran de heredia, 5 v.
