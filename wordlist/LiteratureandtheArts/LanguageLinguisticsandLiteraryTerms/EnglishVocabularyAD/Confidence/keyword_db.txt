Jake Vig (Burns) and his cronies are smalltime con artists who scam the wrong man—an accountant for L.A. crime boss King (Hoffman). To forestall any further unpleasantness, Jake goes to King and agrees to repayment by performing an elaborate con on King's rival. Let's just say that there's always another scam and things are hardly ever what they seem. Hoffman, with king-sized tics and quirks, veers into territory usually reserved for Walken or Pacino, but at least he's having fun. The movie could use a little more of that. Gritty and dark at times, this one's still an enjoyable entry in the scam/heist genre. 98m/C VHS, DVD .
