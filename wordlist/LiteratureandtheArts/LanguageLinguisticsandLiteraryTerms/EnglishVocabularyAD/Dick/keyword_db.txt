, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, If you think Hollywood is done making fun of Nixon, then you don't know “Dick.” Satire puts forth the theory that two dizzy teenage girls (Dunst and Williams) caused the downfall of Richard Nixon (Hedaya). They bump into all the major Watergate players, including Liddy (Shearer), Haldemann (Foley) and Dean (Breuer). The girls are blissfully blind to Tricky Dick's indiscretions, and one of them even develops a hilarious crush on him. When they overhear him abusing the presidential pup, however, they turn on him. Flouting the Constitution is one thing, but being mean to dogs is clearly icky behavior. They decide to become the famed Deep Throat for bickering reporters Woodward (Ferrell) and Bernstein (McCulloch). Rent this with “All the President's Men” and “Nixon,” because this is the movie that Oliver Stone would've made if he had a sense of humor instead of flashbacks. 95m/C VHS, DVD .
