ORIGIN:
early 18th cent. (in the sense ‘cross-shaped’): from French, from Latin crux, cruc- ‘cross.’ The sense ‘decisive’ is from Francis Bacon's Latin phrase instantia crucis ‘crucial instance,’ which he explained as a metaphor from a crux or fingerpost marking a fork at a crossroad; Newton and Boyle took up the metaphor in experimentum crucis ‘crucial experiment.’
