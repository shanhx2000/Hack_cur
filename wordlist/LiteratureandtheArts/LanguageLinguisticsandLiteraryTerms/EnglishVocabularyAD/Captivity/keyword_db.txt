Yeah, they keep coming—only by now anything shocking, original, or smart has been milked. Generic fashion model Jennifer (Cuthbert) has been drugged and abducted for the purpose of sporting torture and mutilation. Forced by her captor to endure one indignity after another as she pleads for her life, Jennifer somehow strikes up an unlikely romance with dungeon mate and hot guy Gillies. Way too grisly to sit through, not even the pretty people can save it. 85m/C DVD .
