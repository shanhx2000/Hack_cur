It shared the fate of Byzantium, passing under the domination of Athenians, Persians, and Romans. It seems to have had a Christian bishop at the end of the 2d century, and Constantine considered establishing his capital there. The scene of the Fourth Ecumenical Council, it was made a metropolitan see without suffragans by Marcian and Pulcheria in 451. After being destroyed by the Persians in a.d. 616, it fell in 1350 to the Turks, who changed its name to Kadiköy., Its most famous church was the basilica of St. euphemia, where the Council of chalcedon was held, and the city proper boasted of its St. George and Holy Redeemer churches as well as of six monasteries. Along the coast toward the east in Hiereia (modern Phanaraki) were the church of the Virgin, the chapel of St. Elias, and the Eutropius monastery; still farther out were the settlement of the Oak (Drys, modern Djadi-Bostan), famous for the church of the Apostles SS. Peter and Paul, where St. john chrysostom was condemned in 403, and three monasteries, including that of St. Satyrus. During the Middle Ages the nearby hills were settled by monks dependent on the monastery of St. Auxentius, which is surrounded by the ruins of Christian monasteries., Chalcedon is the seat of a Greek Orthodox Metropolitan and a Latin titular archbishopric., Bibliography: Paulys Realenzyklopädie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, ed. g. wissowa et al.
