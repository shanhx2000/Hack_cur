, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Name used in the Bible to designate Noah's great grandson, and subsequently, in Talmudic writings, Germania, or more exactly, Lotharingia (modern Lorraine). By extension, this term designates a Jew from a European country, principally central Europe., First inhabiting Flanders and the Rhine Valley, the Ashkenazi Jews emigrated progressively toward eastern Europe, in particular toward Poland. The difference between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, other than their geographic origin, is based mainly on their pronunciation of Hebrew, on their utilization of different forms of a separate language, Yiddish, and in their liturgical rituals and songs. In most countries where there is a Jewish community, there are Ashkenazi synagogues and Sephardic synagogues. The Ashkenazim have become the dominant ethno-cultural group of modern Judaism, and it is they who have propagated the ideals of Zionism. The first waves of immigration into Palestine were comprised mainly of Ashkenazim. One of the main causes for dissension among Israelis is the opposition that exists between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, the latter reproaching the former their control of the country., SEE ALSO Sephardim.,
