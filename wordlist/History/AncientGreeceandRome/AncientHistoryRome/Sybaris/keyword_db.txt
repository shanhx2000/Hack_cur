It was founded in 720 BC by Achaeans and people from Argolis, the Troezenians. It became a wealthy Greek city, and its inhabitants were reputed to live voluptuous lives, hence the word sybaritic. The Troezenians, ejected by the Achaeans, obtained the help of neighboring Crotona and destroyed the city in 510 BC Thurii was supposedly built on the site.
