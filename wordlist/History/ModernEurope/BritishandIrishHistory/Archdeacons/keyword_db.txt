, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Although the title of archdeacon is first referred to by St. Optatus of Milevis (4th century), from the 3d century the bishop would select one of the deacons (not necessarily the senior) to assist him in both the liturgy and administration of the diocese. The office grew in importance as the amount of administration grew, so that by the 5th century the archdeacon was next in importance to the bishop, whom he frequently succeeded. Although at first there was only one, from the 9th century additional archdeacons were appointed (first in France, later elsewhere) within a diocese; they were delegates of the bishop in the areas into which the diocese was divided for administrative purposes. They gradually increased in power and obtained first a share in the bishop's jurisdiction, then independent jurisdiction in courts of their own. Their heyday was in the 12th century; thereafter a succession of councils, culminating in Trent, restricted their power, while as a counterblast to it, bishops appointed their own vicars-general. After the Reformation the English Church did not revive this institution, although it continues to exist in the Anglican Church. In Ireland, archdeacon is the honorific title of the second dignitary of the diocesan chapter., See Also: deacon., Bibliography: a. amanieu, Dictionnaire de droit canonique 1:948–1004. g. w. o. addleshaw, The Beginnings of the Parochial System (St. Anthony's Hall Publications 3; London 1953); The Development of the Parochial System from Charlemagne (768–814) to Urban II (1088–1099) (ibid. 6; London 1954)., [b. forshaw],
