[ASSOCIATIONS. An association is an organization of social equals agreeing to work for a common purpose or to promote a common cause. The twelve English colonies in North America applied this name to their organizations for boycotting British manufactured goods prior to the American Revolution. Merchants in the cities of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia each created formally named associations of nonimportation to protest the Stamp Act in the fall of 1765. These associations dissolved with the Stamp Act's repeal in March 1766, but reformed to protest the Townsend Acts in June 1767. On 18 May 1769, George Washington and George Mason introduced to the Virginia House of Burgesses legislation to establish a colonywide association for nonimportation. The Virginia Association called for the cultivation of crops other than tobacco, an expansion of local manufacturing, a boycott all British goods, and a refusal to accept new slaves into the colony. In the next two years, eight additional colonies created similar associations with locally elected committees of compliance and committees of correspondence. On 20 October 1774, the First Continental Congress established the Continental Association, with stiff penalties for nonobservance of the boycotts declared by Congress. Its committees often became ad hoc local governments during the Revolution., Organizations for purposes other than boycotts also called themselves "associations." During the Revolution, ad hoc militias took the name to justify local looting and pillaging. In New Jersey, the moderately pro-British Association for Retaliation fought the more radical Board of Associated Loyalists between 1780 and 1783 as much as they did the rebels. "Association" later became a popular name for professional and other voluntary organizations in the United States. In 2001, 7,700 national organizations used the term "association," while only 2,700 used the nearly synonymous term "society.", Jensen, Merrill.
