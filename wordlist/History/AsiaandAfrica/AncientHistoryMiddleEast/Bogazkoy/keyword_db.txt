[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Boğazköy or Boghazkeui (bōäz´köy), village, N central Turkey. Boğazköy (or Hattusas as it was called) was the chief center of the Hittite empire (1400–1200 BC), which was consolidated by Shubbiluliuma (fl. 1380 BC). Hugo Winckler found there (1906–7) the principal Hittite inscriptions on 10,000 tablets; this discovery greatly added to the knowledge of Hittite civilization. Among the impressive remains are huge fortifications, gates, and temples. Below this level, archaeologists have found levels of an earlier period. Nearby is the Hittite carved sanctuary of Yazilikaya. Boğazköy is by tradition the site of Pteria, where Croesus and Cyrus the Great fought an indecisive battle (546 BC). The name of the village is also written Boghazkoy.,
