[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Persepolis (pərsĕp´əlĬs) [Gr.,=city of Persia], ancient city of Persia, ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid empire under Darius I and his successors. The administrative capitals were elsewhere, notably at Susa and Babylon. The ruins of Persepolis lie 30 mi (48 km) NE of Shiraz in a fertile plain of the Pulvar River, with strong natural mountain defenses. There are ruins of the palaces of Darius I, Xerxes, and later kings as well as the citadel that contained the treasury looted by Alexander; the ruins lie on a huge platform constructed of limestone from the adjacent mountain. A few miles distant are the rock-hewn tombs of Achaemenid kings and monuments of the Sassanids on a mountainside called by the natives Naqsh-e-Rostam or Naksh-i Rustam [pictures of Rustam] for the legendary Persian hero Rustam. In the same place there is a 3,000-year-old inscription of Shutruk-Nakhkhunte, a famous Elamite king (c.1207–1171 BC). Scattered over the plain, a short distance from the platform of Persepolis, are the ruins of Stakhr or Estakhr, the official capital of the Sassanids, whose administrative capital was Ctesiphon. Excavations have disclosed, 2 mi (3 km) away, a village of the Neolithic period, with mural decorations in red ocher that date back to about 4000 BC

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Animated universal coming-of-age tale spans the life of a young Iranian girl beginning at the tumultuous period from the end of the rule of the Shah through the abrupt transition to the fundamentalist Muslim regime that followed. The profound impact of the many changes Marjane (Mastroianni) endures is heartrending. Although she is part of a modern and progressive Iranian family, she is forced to don a face-covering veil; she then flees to Austria, where she is an outsider stereotyped as a fanatical Muslim. When she finally returns to Iran, she finds that she is an outsider in her native land, and she is forced yet again to flee. Adapted from the semi-autobiographical graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi, the characters are expressed as rather low-tech line drawings when compared to other contemporary animation, but the resulting images and storyline are relatable. 95m/B DVD . FRD: Marjane Satrapi, Vincent Paronnauel; W: Marjane Satrapi, Vincent Paronnauel; M: Olivier Bernet; V: Chiara Mastroianni, Danielle Darrieux, Simon Abkarian, Gabrielle Lopes, Catherine Deneuve, Francois Jerosme.,
