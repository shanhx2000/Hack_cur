[Copyright The Columbia University Press, Leptis (lĕp´tĬs), ancient city of Libya, E of Tripoli. It was founded (c.600 BC) by Phoenicians from Sidon. Annexed (46 BC) to the Roman province of Africa, it flourished as an important port under the Romans, particularly during the reign of Septimius Severus (who had been born in Leptis). Some of the most impressive ruins of Roman Africa are there, including walls, baths, arches, temples, and forums. The city is also known as Lepcis. It is sometimes called Leptis Magna to distinguish it from another Leptis, S of Hadrumetum, in present Tunisia.
