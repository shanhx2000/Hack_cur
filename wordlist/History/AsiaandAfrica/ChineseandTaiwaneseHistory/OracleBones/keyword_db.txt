[Oracle bones were popular tools for divination in ancient China, during that period of the Shang Dynasty, 1776-1122, B.C.E. Two primary objects were utilized, the bones of a now-extinct species of tortoise (Pseudocardia anyangensis ) and the shoulder bones of oxen. The tortoise was a sacred animal in China and appears as a symbol in various divinatory systems including astrology. It was symbolic of long life and was considered a guardian of graves. The ox also acquired an array of symbolic meanings., Pseudocardia anyangensis was bred in ancient China. The part utilized for divination was the relatively soft and flat underlayer called the plastron. It was cleaned, and a number of cavities were cut into the surface. Questions would then be put to the plastron. To discover an answer, a heated rod would be pressed on one of the cavities and in a short time, a crack would appear on the reverse side of the surface. The crack would then be analyzed for its suggested portents. The majority of the surviving examples appear to have been used on behalf of the ruler by court diviners. Many exist only as fragments, as the process of divination often caused the plastron to break in two. In the case of shoulder bones, one end of which is flat, a similar process to that used on the tortoise plastrons was used. Half of the socket would be removed along with the longitudinal ridge, leaving a flat piece of bone with a handle. The first burns would be made
on the end of the blade away from the handle. It also appears that the questions put to the bones would have been asked multiple times in order to determine the drift of the answers rather than simply relying on one response., Archeologists have uncovered extensive collections of oracle bones of both varieties, in many cases bearing a number indicating the use of a filing system. At some point, however, after the fall of the Shang Dynasty, the use of oracle bones gave way to other popular systems of divination, especially the I Ching. , Chang, Kwang-Chih. Shang Civilization.

Along with contemporary inscriptions on bronze vessels, these records of divination, which were incised on the shoulder blades of animals (mainly oxen) and on turtle shells, contain the earliest form of Chinese writing. In addition to being an important source for understanding the development of written Chinese, they tell a great deal about Shang society. Questions asked by the diviners concerned such matters as sacrifices, weather, war, hunting, travel, and luck. The bones were heated to produce cracks from which
"yes"
or
"no"
answers were somehow derived. A small number of oracle bones have the answer and the eventual outcome inscribed. Discovered in the ruins of the Shang capital of Anyang in the late 19th cent., they were first sold as so-called dragon bones to be ground up for use in Chinese medicinal compounds and only received the attention of scholars in the 1920s.,
