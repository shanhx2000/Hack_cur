Major issues were colonialism, economic and cultural cooperation, the legitimacy of defense pacts such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and the viability of peaceful coexistence., The Middle Eastern states were represented by such leaders as Dr. Charles Malik of Lebanon, Dr. Muhammad Fadhil al-Jamali of Iraq, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Prince Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia. The conference passed resolutions supporting the independence struggles of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia against France, and it called for a peaceful settlement of the issue of the Palestinians in accordance with United Nations resolutions., , The Bandung Conference saw Nasser emerge as an international leader. The ties that he established there with Nehru would lead in six years to the first Nonaligned Nations Conference in Belgrade, Yugoslavia., see also

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Copyright The Columbia University Press, Bandung Conference, meeting of representatives of 29 African and Asian nations, held at Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955. The aim—to promote economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism—was more or less achieved in an atmosphere of cordiality. China played a prominent part and strengthened its friendly relations with other Asian nations. Not invited to the conference were South Africa, Israel, Taiwan, South Korea, and North Korea. The conference ultimately led to the establishment of the Nonaligned Movement in 1961. In later years, conflicts between the nonaligned nations eroded the solidarity expressed at Bandung.
