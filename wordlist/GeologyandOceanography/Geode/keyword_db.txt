[Copyright The Columbia University Press, geode (jē´ōd), hollow, globular rock nodule ranging in diameter from 1 to 12 in. (2.54–30.5 cm) or more. Most geodes are partly filled with mineral matter; they have a thin layer of chalcedony (
"wavy"
quartz) covering an inner lining of inward-projecting crystals. These spectacular crystals, generally quartz or, less often, calcite, make geodes highly prized by collectors. Geodes are formed in a cavity such as might be found inside a fossil shell buried in sediment. At the beginning, this cavity is probably filled with a concentrated salt solution. The first step in the creation of a geode is the formation along the inner cavity wall of a layer of gelatinous silica, which will eventually be transformed into the chalcedony layer. As the water surrounding the layer becomes less salty, osmosis induces migration of fluids into the cavity. This results in a buildup of pressure, causing the cavity to expand until the water inside and outside is equally salty. When the silica gel dehydrates, crystallizes to form chalcedony, and cracks, mineral-bearing water enters to slowly deposit the inward-projecting crystals. A geode measuring 26 ft (8 m) long and 6 ft (1.8 m) across was found in an old silver mine near Almería, NE Spain, in 2000. See also concretion.,

, http://www.mla.org/style, http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html, http://apastyle.apa.org/, Geodes are crystal-lined cavities in rock. Geodes are usually roughly spherical in shape and large geodes can be 12 in (30 cm) or more in diameter. Most commonly, the crystals growing within a geode are quartz, calcite, or fluorite, although other minerals can be found in geodes., Most geodes are characterized by an outer shell of chalcedony, a dense microcrystalline form of quartz. The hard outer shell of the geode can usually be separated from the enclosing rock material. Geodes are most often formed in limestone or volcanic rocks, and are rarely found in mudstones and shales. The mineralogy of the geode and the rock in which it formed are commonly different. Because chalcedony is often harder and more weather resistant than the host rock, the hollow spheres resist the effects of erosion and are left behind as the host rock is eroded. Collectors identify the geodes in the field based upon their shape, the characteristic chalcedony shell, and the lower density arising from the hollow center., The initial requirement for the formation of a geode is a cavity in the host rock. In a volcanic rock, voids commonly form as gas is released from lava. As the lava cools and hardens into rock, the gas bubbles are preserved as holes in the rock. In sedimentary rocks such as limestone, a hole may develop as groundwater dissolves the rock itself or as a result of the decay of biologic material buried at the time of deposition of the sediments. Groundwater within the sediments then carries dissolved minerals, including silica, through the host rock and into the cavity. The chalcedony shell is formed first, fully hardening only after an extended period of time. Subsequent mineralized groundwater flow may then deposit additional layers of minerals within the void. These crystal growths form first on the walls of the shell and then grow toward the center, producing the distinctive crystalline interior of the geode. The formation of a geode with large crystals may require tens or hundreds of millions of years., Some of the most spectacular geodes, which can be as large as 1 yd (1 m) in diameter and contain very, large amethyst (purple quartz) crystals, come from Brazil. Once found, geodes are often cut open with a diamond-tipped saw blade and the cut surfaces of the sphere polished for display.,
